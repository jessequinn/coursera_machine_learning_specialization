00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,518
We've now seen how to compute the log
likelihood, but before continuing,

3
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:11,738
we're going to have to express
the probability of y = -1

4
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:15,190
because we've only so
far expressed the probability y = +1.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,110
This is still part of that very,

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,390
very optional PhD level only
derivation of the gradient.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,163
So this is only for
those who are really interested.

8
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:28,919
We need to take a moment to derive
what is the probability that y = -1

9
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,951
if the following up here is
the probability that y = +1?

10
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,010
So let's just derive that.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,800
So the probability that y = -1 given x and
w

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,680
is just one minus the probability
that y is equal to +1 given x and w.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,850
This is just because
probabilities add up to one.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:58,330
So, let's plug that in,
that's one minus one times one plus

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,300
E to the minus W transpose h(x).

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,130
I just plugged it in with
the definition of probability of y=+1.

17
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:18,250
Now, if we multiply both elements
by 1+e to the -w transpose x,

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,195
we get the probability
that y is equal to -1 is,

19
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:33,170
so I'm multiplying both terms
by 1+e to the -w transpose h(x).

20
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:40,076
So the one is 1 + e to
the -w transpose h(x) and

21
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:45,000
then you get 80 minus one.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,727
So the whole thing here simplifies to e

23
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:54,454
to the -w transpose h(x) divided by

24
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:58,897
1+e to the -w transpose h(x).

25
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,420
Pretty cool.

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,100
Very simple.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,965
Here we go.
