2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,648
So, here's the rule of
thumb of how you can pick

3
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:18,027
the learning step size eta when
you're doing graded descent.

4
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:23,280
Unfortunately, there's some theory
behind things they might want to do,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,780
but it's kind of hard to
apply those in practice.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,880
Here's the most practical
thing you can do.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,130
You try several values of the parameter,
exponentially spaced between each other.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,770
Like 10 to the minus 4, to 10 to
the minus 6, that's exponentially spaced.

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,870
And the goal is plot the learning curves
to find an eta that is too small.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,390
So the curve is moving too slowly,
too slowly, too slowly.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,640
And then you find an eta that is too
large, these wild oscillations and

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,548
it's diverging even.

13
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:57,292
And now we have a big value and
a small value,

14
00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:01,781
and then, you can try values in between,

15
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:05,254
again, exponentially space.

16
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:13,202
Spaced and pick one that leads to

17
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:18,055
the best training likelihood.

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,650
And that's how you do it.

19
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,430
Pretty simple heuristic, but
it's basically something that you

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,300
will have to do if you're
implementing this from scratch.

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,620
Now note that so
far we've looked at only fixed step size.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,770
Every iteration we used
the same step size,

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,480
like ten to the minus five, everywhere.

24
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,090
Here's an advanced step.

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,499
In theory and often in practice,

26
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:52,720
it's good to pick step sizes
that decrease over iterations.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,638
So in the beginning,

28
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:57,390
you take really big steps because
you're very far away from the optimum.

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,737
But towards the end they
take much smaller steps,

30
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:04,250
smaller steps to just hone
in to that perfect value.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,150
So if you imagine you
take the contour plots,

32
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,930
in the beginning you're taking
big steps like this, but

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:16,050
to be able to get to the optimum, you
take very little steps towards the end.

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,540
And that's how you kind of hone
in to the optimal here w hat.

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,145
So what is that equation for
the step size look like?

36
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:29,123
There may be various
ways of defining them.

37
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:33,705
I'm just going to give you one pretty
practical example, which often works well.

38
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:38,740
So you pick a step size that depends
on the iterations of iteration t.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,030
You're going to use eta t.

40
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,595
And the way you're going to
write it is by writing eta 0.

41
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:52,005
Some constant that you tune using the same
kinds of ideas that are described above to

42
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,650
find the minimum, the maximum,
the range in between.

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,650
And then you divide that
by the iteration number t.

44
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,600
以上です

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,940
So iteration one use eta 0.

46
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,130
Iteration two use eta 0 over 2.

47
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,250
Iteration three it is 0 over 3,
over 4, over 5, and so on.

48
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,280
And that way the step size keeps getting
smaller and smaller and smaller.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,970
So this is an advanced step for the
applications that we're going to discuss

50
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,030
in this module, constant step
size will do just fine for you.

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,730
But, for kind of more advanced settings,
you might use a decreasing step size.

52
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,999
