2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,860
So now let's try a little bit larger and
compare and see what happens.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,978
So remember we have our first curve,
the blue curve,

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,000
where eta was 10 to the minus 5.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,893
Then we have the scion curve
where eta was 50% larger so

6
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:24,494
10 to 1.5 times 10 to the -5.

7
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:27,620
And now we tried even larger parameter.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,913
So this is the red line,

9
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:37,500
this is eta = 2.5 times 10 to the -5.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,920
So this is 2.5 times
bigger than the blue line.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,660
And what we see, we see bigger
oscillations in the beginning and

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,630
the early oscillation phase goes on for
a long time.

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,728
As you see, the oscillations
are decreasing towards the end, but

14
00:00:54,728 --> 00:01:03,380
decreasing, but we still pick
the parameter that is too big.

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,840
You see the oscillations
is not converging.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,147
There's a gap, significant gap
in the likelihood function,

17
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:18,990
l of w so the red one,
2.5 times 10 to the -5 is too big.

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,320
So let's understand a little better
why those oscillations come about.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,639
So, if I were to use the loose,

20
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:31,300
very smooth step size, what happens is,
I start from the starting point and

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,790
I take these little steps and I'm kind
of following this nice smooth curve.

22
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,210
All the way to my desired parameter,
w hat.

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,170
If you pick a step size that is too big,

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,720
I look at a gradient here and it's looking
pretty good, a direction in the beginning.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,620
So let me change colors there
just to make it super obvious.

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,400
So I'm going to use

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,670
green to the note that this step size,
which is too big, so I start here.

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,130
I find the gradient direction but
I take a step that's too big.

29
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,460
Boom, I went to somewhere
really far away over here so

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,890
it took an eta that was too big.

31
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,420
And now I compute the gradient here,
and it's in this direction,

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,430
and boom, we took a step size of too big.

33
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,660
I ended up over here, and
then I compute the gradient and

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,070
I get something in this direction and then
boom I take a step size that's too big,

35
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,050
I ended up here and
that step size is too big and so on.

36
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,300
And you keep oscillating back and
forth these really big steps.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,220
Now in this case, in the red line,
2.5 x 10 to the minus 5.

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,100
You see this oscillations are decreasing,
so

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,650
eventually it's going to get closer and
closer to w hat.

40
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,390
But you have to be careful.

41
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,910
Now let's see what happens when we pick
a eta parameter, they're just too,

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,350
too, too large.

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,360
What I've done here is taken
a much bigger parameter, so

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,650
I picked a eta,
which has a step size 10 to the -4.

45
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,179
Remember they're the ones who
were over ten to minus five,

46
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:21,274
as you can see they're increasing,
this is ten to the minus four, so

47
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:25,748
ten times bigger than this blue line
here which is eta ten to the minus five.

48
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,940
First thing they observe is
why all the oscillations?

49
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,646
This parameter is too big,
things are going everywhere,

50
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:38,929
doesn't seem to be converging and
the likelihood value is much,

51
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:42,320
much lower than of the other parameters.

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,310
The other way to look at it is, look,
we thought that the difference between

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,810
the red parameter, which was, we thought
was too big and the blue parameter,

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,840
which was better with
the cyan one was a big gap,

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,270
but look at the gap between, this all
curves look really small because we had to

56
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,380
make the scale much bigger to
show this wildly oscillating one.

57
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,390
So ten to the minus four was too big.

58
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,860
So here's what I've learned, we've
learned that ten to minus six, too small,

59
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,580
ten to the minus four is too big.

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,627
Now, we have a range between
the too big and too small, and

61
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:20,616
we can search in that range.

62
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:25,009
