 <p>
  <strong>
   Extracting the target and the feature columns
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2.
  </strong>
  We will now repeat some of the feature processing steps that we saw in the previous assignment:
 </p>
 <p>
  First, we re-assign the target to have +1 as a safe (good) loan, and -1 as a risky (bad) loan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, we select four categorical features:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    grade of the loan
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    the length of the loan term
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    the home ownership status: own, mortgage, rent
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    number of years of employment.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Your code should be analogous to the following:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">features = ['grade',              # grade of the loan
            'term',               # the term of the loan
            'home_ownership',     # home ownership status: own, mortgage or rent
            'emp_length',         # number of years of employment
           ]
loans['safe_loans'] = loans['bad_loans'].apply(lambda x : +1 if x==0 else -1)
loans.remove_column('bad_loans')
target = 'safe_loans'
loans = loans[features + [target]]</pre>

  <strong>
   If you are using SFrame, proceed to the section "
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Subsample dataset to make sure classes are balanced".
  </strong>

 <p>
  <strong>
   If you are NOT using SFrame, download the list of indices for the training and test sets

 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Apply one-hot encoding to
    <strong>
     loans
    </strong>
    . Your tool may have a function for one-hot encoding. Alternatively, see #7 for implementation hints.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Load the JSON files into the lists
    <strong>

  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Perform train/validation split using
    <strong>
     train_idx
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     test_idx
    </strong>
    . In Pandas, for instance:
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <pre language="python">train_data = loans.iloc[train_idx]
test_data = loans.iloc[test_idx]</pre>
 <p>
  IMPORTANT: If you are using a programming language with 1-based indexing (e.g. R, Matlab), make sure to increment all indices by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note. Some elements in loans are included neither in
  <strong>
   train_data
  </strong>
  nor
  <strong>
   test_data
  </strong>
  . This is to perform sampling to achieve class balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now proceed to the section "Weighted decision trees", skipping three sections below.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Subsample dataset to make sure classes are balanced
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3.
  </strong>
  Just as we did in the previous assignment, we will undersample the larger class (safe loans) in order to balance out our dataset. This means we are throwing away many data points. We use seed=1 so everyone gets the same results. Your code should be analogous to the following:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">safe_loans_raw = loans[loans[target] == 1]
risky_loans_raw = loans[loans[target] == -1]
# Undersample the safe loans.
percentage = len(risky_loans_raw)/float(len(safe_loans_raw))
risky_loans = risky_loans_raw
safe_loans = safe_loans_raw.sample(percentage, seed=1)
loans_data = risky_loans_raw.append(safe_loans)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Note:
  </strong>
  There are many approaches for dealing with imbalanced data, including some where we modify the learning algorithm. These approaches are beyond the scope of this course, but some of them are reviewed in this
  <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5128907&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F69%2F5173046%2F05128907.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5128907">
   paper
  </a>
  . For this assignment, we use the simplest possible approach, where we subsample the overly represented class to get a more balanced dataset. In general, and especially when the data is highly imbalanced, we recommend using more advanced methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Transform categorical data into binary features
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4.
  </strong>
  Just like the previous assignment, we will implement
  <strong>
   binary decision trees
  </strong>
  . Since all of our features are currently categorical features, we want to turn them into binary features. Here is a reminder of what one-hot encoding is.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, the
  <strong>
   home_ownership
  </strong>
  feature represents the home ownership status of the loanee, which is either own, mortgage or rent. For example, if a data point has the feature
 </p>
 <pre language="python">   {'home_ownership': 'RENT'}</pre>
 <p>
  we want to turn this into three features:
 </p>
 <pre language="python"> { 
   'home_ownership = OWN'      : 0, 
   'home_ownership = MORTGAGE' : 0, 
   'home_ownership = RENT'     : 1
 }</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5.
  </strong>
  This technique of turning categorical variables into binary variables is called one-hot encoding. Using the software of your choice, perform one-hot encoding on the four features described above.
  <strong>
   You should now have 25 binary features.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Train-test split
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   6.
  </strong>
  We split the data into training and test sets with 80% of the data in the training set and 20% of the data in the test set. We use seed=1 so that everyone gets the same result.  Using SFrame, this would look like:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">train_data, test_data = loans_data.random_split(.8, seed=1)</pre>
 <p>
  (with
  <strong>
   seed=1
  </strong>
  to ensure people get the same results.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Call the training and test sets
  <strong>
   train_data
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   test_data
  </strong>
  , respectively.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Weighted decision trees
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   7.
  </strong>
  Let's modify our decision tree code from Module 5 to support weighting of individual data points.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Weighted error definition
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   8.
  </strong>
  Consider a model with N data points with:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    Predictions $$\hat{y}_1, \ldots, \hat{y}_n$$
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    Target $$y_1, \ldots, y_n$$
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    Data point weights $$\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$$
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Then the
  <strong>
   weighted error
  </strong>
  is defined by:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times \mathbf{1}[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}$$
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  where $$\mathbf{1}[ y_i \neq \hat{y}_i ]$$ is an indicator function that is set to 1 if $$y_i \neq \hat{y}_i$$.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Write a function to compute weight of mistakes
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   9.
  </strong>
  Write a function that calculates the weight of mistakes for making the "weighted-majority" predictions for a dataset. The function accepts two inputs:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    <strong>
     labels_in_node
    </strong>
    : $$y_1, \ldots, y_n$$
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    <strong>
     data_weights
    </strong>
    : Data point weights $$\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$$
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  We are interested in computing the (total) weight of mistakes, i.e.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\displaystyle \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times \mathbf{1}[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]$$
 </p>
 <p>
  This quantity is analogous to the number of mistakes, except that each mistake now carries different weight. It is related to the weighted error in the following way:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\displaystyle \mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \frac{\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}$$
 </p>
 <p>
  The function
  <strong>
   intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes
  </strong>
  should first compute two weights:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    $$\mathrm{WM}_{-1}$$: weight of mistakes when all predictions are $$\hat{y}_i = -1$$ i.e. $$\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{-1})$$
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    $$\mathrm{WM}_{+1}$$: weight of mistakes when all predictions are $$\hat{y}_i = +1$$ i.e. $$\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{+1})$$
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  where
  <strong>
   −1
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   +1
  </strong>
  are vectors where all values are -1 and +1 respectively.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  After computing $$\mathrm{WM}_{-1}$$ and $$\mathrm{WM}_{+1}$$, the function
  <strong>
   intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes
  </strong>
  should return the lower of the two weights of mistakes, along with the class associated with that weight. The function should be analogous to the following Python function:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes(labels_in_node, data_weights):
    # Sum the weights of all entries with label +1
    total_weight_positive = sum(data_weights[labels_in_node == +1])
    
    # Weight of mistakes for predicting all -1's is equal to the sum above
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    weighted_mistakes_all_negative = ...
    
    # Sum the weights of all entries with label -1
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    total_weight_negative = ...
    
    # Weight of mistakes for predicting all +1's is equal to the sum above
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    weighted_mistakes_all_positive = ...
    
    # Return the tuple (weight, class_label) representing the lower of the two weights
    #    class_label should be an integer of value +1 or -1.
    # If the two weights are identical, return (weighted_mistakes_all_positive,+1)
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    ...</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   10.
  </strong>
  Recall that the
  <strong>
   classification error
  </strong>
  is defined as follows:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\mbox{classification error} = \frac{\mbox{# mistakes}}{\mbox{# all data points}}$$
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  <strong>
   Quiz Question:
  </strong>
  If we set the weights $$\alpha =1$$ for all data points, how is the weight of mistakes $$\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$$ related to the classification error?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Function to pick best feature to split on
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   11.
  </strong>
  We continue modifying our decision tree code from the earlier assignment to incorporate weighting of individual data points. The next step is to pick the best feature to split on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   best_splitting_feature
  </strong>
  function is similar to the one from the earlier assignment with two minor modifications:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    The function
    <strong>
     best_splitting_feature
    </strong>
    should now accept an extra parameter data_weights to take account of weights of data points.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Instead of computing the number of mistakes in the left and right side of the split, we compute the weight of mistakes for both sides, add up the two weights, and divide it by the total weight of the data.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Your function should be analogous to the following Python function:
 </p>
 <pre language="python"># If the data is identical in each feature, this function should return None

def best_splitting_feature(data, features, target, data_weights):
    
    # These variables will keep track of the best feature and the corresponding error
    best_feature = None
    best_error = float('+inf') 
    num_points = float(len(data))

    # Loop through each feature to consider splitting on that feature
    for feature in features:
        
        # The left split will have all data points where the feature value is 0
        # The right split will have all data points where the feature value is 1
        left_split = data[data[feature] == 0]
        right_split = data[data[feature] == 1]
        
        # Apply the same filtering to data_weights to create left_data_weights, right_data_weights
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        left_data_weights = ...
        right_data_weights = ...
                    
        # DIFFERENT HERE
        # Calculate the weight of mistakes for left and right sides
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        left_weighted_mistakes, left_class = ...
        right_weighted_mistakes, right_class = ...
        
        # DIFFERENT HERE
        # Compute weighted error by computing
        #  ( [weight of mistakes (left)] + [weight of mistakes (right)] ) / [total weight of all data points]
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        error = ...
        
        # If this is the best error we have found so far, store the feature and the error
        if error &lt; best_error:
            best_feature = feature

    # Return the best feature we found
    return best_feature</pre>

  . Relationship between weighted error and weight of mistakes
 </p>
 <p>
  By definition, the weighted error is the weight of mistakes divided by the weight of all data points, so
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times \mathbf{1}[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i} = \dfrac{\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}.$$
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  In the code above, we obtain $$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$$ from the two weights of mistakes from both sides, $$\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{left}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{left}})$$ and $$\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{right}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{right}})$$. First, notice that the overall weight of mistakes $$\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$$ can be broken into two weights of mistakes over either side of the split:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\displaystyle \begin{align} \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \times \mathbf{1}[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}] \\ &amp;= \sum_{\mathrm{left}} \alpha_i \times \mathbf{1}[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}] + \sum_{\mathrm{right}} \alpha_i \times \mathbf{1}[y_i \neq \hat{y_i}]\\ &amp;= \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{left}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{left}}) + \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{right}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{right}}) \end{align}$$
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  We then divide through by the total weight of all data points to obtain $$\mathrm{E}(\alpha, \mathbf{\hat{y}})$$:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}) = \dfrac{\mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{left}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{left}}) + \mathrm{WM}(\mathbf{\alpha}_{\mathrm{right}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}}_{\mathrm{right}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i}$$

  Building the tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   12.
  </strong>
  With the above functions implemented correctly, we are now ready to build our decision tree. Recall from the previous assignments that each node in the decision tree is represented as a dictionary which contains the following keys:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">{ 
   'is_leaf'            : True/False.
   'prediction'         : Prediction at the leaf node.
   'left'               : (dictionary corresponding to the left tree).
   'right'              : (dictionary corresponding to the right tree).
   'features_remaining' : List of features that are posible splits.
}</pre>
 <p>
  Let us start with a function that creates a leaf node given a set of target values. The
  <strong>
   create_leaf
  </strong>
  function should be analogous to the following cell:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def create_leaf(target_values, data_weights):
    
    # Create a leaf node
    leaf = {'splitting_feature' : None,
            'is_leaf': True}
    
    # Computed weight of mistakes.
    # Store the predicted class (1 or -1) in leaf['prediction']
    weighted_error, best_class = intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes(target_values, data_weights)
    leaf['prediction'] = ... ## YOUR CODE HERE
    
    return leaf</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   13.
  </strong>
  Now write a function that learns a weighted decision tree recursively and implements 3 stopping conditions:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    All data points in a node are from the same class.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    No more features to split on.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Stop growing the tree when the tree depth reaches
    <strong>
     max_depth
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Since there are many steps involved, we provide you with a Python skeleton, along with explanatory comments.
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def weighted_decision_tree_create(data, features, target, data_weights, current_depth = 1, max_depth = 10):
    remaining_features = features[:] # Make a copy of the features.
    target_values = data[target]
    print "--------------------------------------------------------------------"
    print "Subtree, depth = %s (%s data points)." % (current_depth, len(target_values))
    
    # Stopping condition 1. Error is 0.
    if intermediate_node_weighted_mistakes(target_values, data_weights)[0] &lt;= 1e-15:
        print "Stopping condition 1 reached."                
        return create_leaf(target_values, data_weights)
    
    # Stopping condition 2. No more features.
    if remaining_features == []:
        print "Stopping condition 2 reached."                
        return create_leaf(target_values, data_weights)    
    
    # Additional stopping condition (limit tree depth)
    if current_depth &gt; max_depth:
        print "Reached maximum depth. Stopping for now."
        return create_leaf(target_values, data_weights)
    
    # If all the datapoints are the same, splitting_feature will be None. Create a leaf
    splitting_feature = best_splitting_feature(data, features, target, data_weights)
    remaining_features.remove(splitting_feature)
        
    left_split = data[data[splitting_feature] == 0]
    right_split = data[data[splitting_feature] == 1]
    
    left_data_weights = data_weights[data[splitting_feature] == 0]
    right_data_weights = data_weights[data[splitting_feature] == 1]
    
    print "Split on feature %s. (%s, %s)" % (\
              splitting_feature, len(left_split), len(right_split))
    
    # Create a leaf node if the split is "perfect"
    if len(left_split) == len(data):
        print "Creating leaf node."
        return create_leaf(left_split[target], data_weights)
    if len(right_split) == len(data):
        print "Creating leaf node."
        return create_leaf(right_split[target], data_weights)
    
    # Repeat (recurse) on left and right subtrees
    left_tree = weighted_decision_tree_create(
        left_split, remaining_features, target, left_data_weights, current_depth + 1, max_depth)
    right_tree = weighted_decision_tree_create(
        right_split, remaining_features, target, right_data_weights, current_depth + 1, max_depth)
    
    return {'is_leaf'          : False, 
            'prediction'       : None,

            'right'            : right_tree}</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   14.
  </strong>
  Finally, write a recursive function to count the nodes in your tree. The function should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def count_nodes(tree):
    if tree['is_leaf']:
        return 1
    return 1 + count_nodes(tree['left']) + count_nodes(tree['right'])</pre>
 <h3 level="3">
  Making predictions with a weighted decision tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   15.
  </strong>
  To make a single prediction, we must start at the root and traverse down the decision tree in recursive fashion. Write a function
  <strong>
   classify
  </strong>
  that makes a single prediction. It should be analogous to the following:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def classify(tree, x, annotate = False):   
    # If the node is a leaf node.
    if tree['is_leaf']:
        if annotate: 
            print "At leaf, predicting %s" % tree['prediction']
        return tree['prediction'] 
    else:
        # Split on feature.
        split_feature_value = x[tree['splitting_feature']]
        if annotate: 
            print "Split on %s = %s" % (tree['splitting_feature'], split_feature_value)
        if split_feature_value == 0:
            return classify(tree['left'], x, annotate)
        else:
            return classify(tree['right'], x, annotate)</pre>
 <h3 level="3">
  Evaluating the tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   16.
  </strong>
  Create a function called
  <strong>
   evaluate_classification_error
  </strong>
  . It takes in as input:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     tree
    </strong>
    (as described above)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     data
    </strong>
    (an data frame)
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The function does not change because of adding data point weights.  It is analogous to this Python function:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def evaluate_classification_error(tree, data):
    # Apply the classify(tree, x) to each row in your data
    prediction = data.apply(lambda x: classify(tree, x))
    
    # Once you've made the predictions, calculate the classification error
    return (prediction != data[target]).sum() / float(len(data))</pre>
 <p>
  Example: Training a weighted decision tree
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   17.
  </strong>
  To build intuition on how weighted data points affect the tree being built, consider the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose we only care about making good predictions for the
  <strong>
   first 10 and last 10 items
  </strong>
  in train_data, we assign weights:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    1 to the last 10 items
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    1 to the first 10 items
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    and 0 to the rest.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Let us fit a weighted decision tree with max_depth = 2. Then compute the classification error on the
  <strong>
   subset_20
  </strong>
  , i.e. the subset of data points whose weight is 1 (namely the first and last 10 data points).
 </p>
 <pre language="python"># Assign weights
example_data_weights = graphlab.SArray([1.] * 10 + [0.]*(len(train_data) - 20) + [1.] * 10)
# Train a weighted decision tree model.
small_data_decision_tree_subset_20 = weighted_decision_tree_create(train_data, features, target,
                         example_data_weights, max_depth=2)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   18.
  </strong>
  Now, we will compute the classification error on the
  <strong>
   subset_20
  </strong>
  , i.e. the subset of data points whose weight is 1 (namely the first and last 10 data points).
 </p>
 <pre language="python">evaluate_classification_error(small_data_decision_tree_subset_20, train_data)</pre>
 <p>
  The model small_data_decision_tree_subset_20 performs
  <strong>
   a lot
  </strong>
  better on subset_20 than on train_data.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, what does this mean?
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    The points with higher weights are the ones that are more important during the training process of the weighted decision tree.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The points with zero weights are basically ignored during training.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz Question
  </strong>
  : Will you get the same model as
  <strong>
   small_data_decision_tree_subset_20
  </strong>
  if you trained a decision tree with only the 20 data points with non-zero weights from the set of points in

  Implementing your own Adaboost (on decision stumps)
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   19.
  </strong>
  Now that we have a weighted decision tree working, it takes only a bit of work to implement Adaboost. For the sake of simplicity, let us stick with decision tree stumps by training trees with max_depth=1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recall from the lecture the procedure for Adaboost:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  * Start with unweighted data with $$\alpha_j = 1$$
 </p>
 <p>
  * For t=1,...,T:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">

   <p hasmath="true">
    Learn $$f_t(x)$$ with data weights $$\alpha_j$$
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    Compute coefficient $$\hat{w}_t$$:
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\hat{w}_t = \dfrac{1}{2}\ln{\left(\dfrac{1- \mbox{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}{\mbox{E}(\mathbf{\alpha}, \mathbf{\hat{y}})}\right)}$$
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">
    Re-compute weights $$\alpha_j$$:
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\alpha_j \gets \begin{cases} \alpha_j \exp{(-\hat{w}_t)} &amp; \text{ if }f_t(x_j) = y_j\\\alpha_j \exp{(\hat{w}_t)} &amp; \text{ if }f_t(x_j) \neq y_j \end{cases}$$
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p hasmath="true">

   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\alpha_j \gets \dfrac{\alpha_j}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\alpha_i}}$$
 </p>
 <p>
  Now write your own Adaboost function. The function accepts 4 parameters:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    data: a data frame with binary features
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    target: name of target column
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    num_tree_stumps: number of tree stumps to train for the ensemble
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The function should return the list of tree stumps, along with the list of corresponding tree stump weights.
 </p>
 <p>
  It should be analogous to the following code skeleton:

  : Which of the following best describes a
  <strong>
   general trend in accuracy
  </strong>
  as we add more and more components? Answer based on the 30 components learned so far.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Training error goes down monotonically, i.e. the training error reduces with each iteration but never increases.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Training error goes down in general, with some ups and downs in the middle.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Training error goes up in general, with some ups and downs in the middle.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Training error goes down in the beginning, achieves the best error, and then goes up sharply.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    None of the above
   </p>
  </li>

  Performing well on the training data is cheating, so lets make sure it works on the test_data as well. Here, we will compute the classification error on the test_data at the end of each iteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  For n = 1 to 30, do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Make predictions on
    <strong>
     test_data
    </strong>
    using tree stumps 0, ..., n-1.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Compute classification error for the predictions
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Record the classification error for that n.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 level="3">
  Visualize both the training and test errors
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
