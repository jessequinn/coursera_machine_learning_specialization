  Hello Machine Learning learners,
 </p>
 <p>
  Please know that due to unforeseen circumstances,  courses 5 and 6 -
  <em>
   Recommender Systems &amp; Dimensionality Reduction
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   An Intelligent Application with Deep Learning
  </em>
  - will not be launching as part of the Machine Learning Specialization. We understand this may come as very disappointing news and weâ€™re deeply sorry for this inconvenience. If you have paid for these courses or have received financial aid from Coursera, you will remain eligible to earn your Specialization Certificate upon successfully completing courses 1-4 of the Specialization.
 </p>
 <p>
  We value you as a Coursera learner and want to ensure that your experience with the Machine Learning Specialization remains a positive one.
