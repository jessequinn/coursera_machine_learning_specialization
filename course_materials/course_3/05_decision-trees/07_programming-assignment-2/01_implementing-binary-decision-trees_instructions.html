  <strong>
   Important Note
  </strong>
  : In this assignment, we will focus on building decision trees where the data contain
  <strong>
   only binary (0 or 1) features
  </strong>
  . This allows us to avoid dealing with:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Multiple intermediate nodes in a split
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The thresholding issues of real-valued features.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This assignment
  <strong>
   may be challenging

  If you are NOT using SFrame
 </h2>
 <p>
  1. Load in the LendingClub dataset with the software of your choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Like the previous assignment, reassign the labels to have +1 for a safe loan, and -1 for a risky (bad) loan. You should have code analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">loans['safe_loans'] = loans['bad_loans'].apply(lambda x : +1 if x==0 else -1)
loans = loans.remove_column('bad_loans')</pre>
 <p>
  3. Unlike the previous assignment, we will only be considering these four features:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">features = ['grade',              # grade of the loan
            'term',               # the term of the loan

           ]
target = 'safe_loans'</pre>
 <p>
  Extract these feature columns from the dataset, and discard the rest of the feature columns.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Notes to people using other tools
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   If you are using SFrame, proceed to the section "
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Subsample dataset to make sure classes are balanced
  </strong>
  <strong>
   ".
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   If you are NOT using SFrame, download the list of indices for the training and test sets
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="zip" id="eeBzCpcCEea2tg7d5YqbXg" name="module-5-assignment-2-train-idx.json">
 </asset>
 <asset assettype="generic" extension="zip" id="ega_jZcCEeaMvRLid-X_BA" name="module-5-assignment-2-test-idx.json">
 </asset>
 <p>
  Then follow the following steps:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Apply one-hot encoding to
    <strong>
     loans
    </strong>
    . Your tool may have a function for one-hot encoding.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Load the JSON files into the lists
    <strong>
     train_idx
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     test_idx
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Perform train/validation split using
    <strong>
     train_idx
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     test_idx
    </strong>
    . In Pandas, for instance:
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <pre language="python">train_data = loans.iloc[train_idx]
test_data = loans.iloc[test_idx]</pre>
 <p>
  IMPORTANT: If you are using a programming language with 1-based indexing (e.g. R, Matlab), make sure to increment all indices by 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note. Some elements in loans are included neither in
  <strong>
   train_data
  </strong>
  nor
  <strong>
   test_data
  </strong>
  . This is to perform sampling to achieve class balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now proceed to the section "Decision tree implementation", skipping three sections below.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Subsample dataset to make sure classes are balanced
 </h3>
 <p>
  4. Just as we did in the previous assignment, we will undersample the larger class (safe loans) in order to balance out our dataset. This means we are throwing away many data points. You should have code analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">safe_loans_raw = loans[loans[target] == 1]
risky_loans_raw = loans[loans[target] == -1]

# Since there are less risky loans than safe loans, find the ratio of the sizes
# and use that percentage to undersample the safe loans.
percentage = len(risky_loans_raw)/float(len(safe_loans_raw))
safe_loans = safe_loans_raw.sample(percentage, seed = 1)
risky_loans = risky_loans_raw
loans_data = risky_loans.append(safe_loans)

print "Percentage of safe loans                 :", len(safe_loans) / float(len(loans_data))
print "Percentage of risky loans                :", len(risky_loans) / float(len(loans_data))
print "Total number of loans in our new dataset :", len(loans_data)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Note:
  </strong>
  There are many approaches for dealing with imbalanced data, including some where we modify the learning algorithm. These approaches are beyond the scope of this course, but some of them are reviewed in this
  <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5128907&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F69%2F5173046%2F05128907.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5128907">
   paper
  </a>
  . For this assignment, we use the simplest possible approach, where we subsample the overly represented class to get a more balanced dataset. In general, and especially when the data is highly imbalanced, we recommend using more advanced methods.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Transform categorical data into binary features
 </h3>
 <p>
  In this assignment, we will implement
  <strong>
   binary decision trees
  </strong>
  (decision trees for binary features, a specific case of categorical variables taking on two values, e.g., true/false). Since all of our features are currently categorical features, we want to turn them into binary features.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, the
  <strong>
   home_ownership
  </strong>
  feature represents the home ownership status of the loanee, which is either own, mortgage or rent. For example, if a data point has the feature
 </p>
 <pre language="python">   {'home_ownership': 'RENT'}</pre>
 <p>
  we want to turn this into three features:
 </p>
 <pre language="python"> { 
   'home_ownership = OWN'      : 0, 
   'home_ownership = MORTGAGE' : 0, 
   'home_ownership = RENT'     : 1
 }</pre>
 <p>
  5. This technique of turning categorical variables into binary variables is called one-hot encoding. Using the software of your choice, perform one-hot encoding on the four features described above.
  <strong>
   You should now have 25 binary features.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Train-test split
 </h3>
 <p>
  6. Split the data into a train test split with 80% of the data in the training set and 20% of the data in the test set. Call these datasets
  <strong>
   train_data
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   test_data
  </strong>
  , respectively. Using SFrame, this would look like:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">train_data, test_data = loans_data.random_split(.8, seed=1)</pre>
 <p>
  (with
  <strong>
   seed=1
  </strong>
  to ensure people get the same results.)
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Decision tree implementation
 </h3>
 <p>
  In this section, we will implement binary decision trees from scratch. There are several steps involved in building a decision tree. For that reason, we have split the entire assignment into several sections.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Function to count number of mistakes while predicting majority class
 </h3>
 <p>
  Recall from the lecture that prediction at an intermediate node works by predicting the
  <strong>
   majority class
  </strong>
  for all data points that belong to this node. Now, we will write a function that calculates the number of
  <strong>
   misclassified examples
  </strong>
  when predicting the
  <strong>
   majority class
  </strong>
  . This will be used to help determine which feature is the best to split on at a given node of the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Note
  </strong>
  : Keep in mind that in order to compute the number of mistakes for a majority classifier, we only need the label (y values) of the data points in the node.
 </p>
 <p>
  Steps to follow:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Step 1: Calculate the number of safe loans and risky loans.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Step 2: Since we are assuming majority class prediction, all the data points that are not in the majority class are considered mistakes.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Step 3: Return the number of mistakes.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  7. Now, let us write the function
  <em>
   intermediate_node_num_mistakes
  </em>
  which computes the number of misclassified examples of an intermediate node given the set of labels (y values) of the data points contained in the node. Your code should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def intermediate_node_num_mistakes(labels_in_node):
    # Corner case: If labels_in_node is empty, return 0
    if len(labels_in_node) == 0:
        return 0    
    # Count the number of 1's (safe loans)
    ## YOUR CODE HERE    
    # Count the number of -1's (risky loans)
    ## YOUR CODE HERE                
    # Return the number of mistakes that the majority classifier makes.
    ## YOUR CODE HERE    
</pre>
 <p>
  8. Because there are several steps in this assignment, we have introduced some stopping points where you can check your code and make sure it is correct before proceeding. To test your
  <em>
   intermediate_node_num_mistakes
  </em>
  function, run the following code until you get a
  <strong>
   Test passed!
  </strong>
  , then you should proceed. Otherwise, you should spend some time figuring out where things went wrong. Again, remember that this code is specific to SFrame, but using your software of choice, you can construct similar tests.
 </p>
 <pre language="python"># Test case 1
example_labels = graphlab.SArray([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1])
if intermediate_node_num_mistakes(example_labels) == 2:
    print 'Test passed!'
else:
    print 'Test 1 failed... try again!'

# Test case 2
example_labels = graphlab.SArray([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
if intermediate_node_num_mistakes(example_labels) == 2:
    print 'Test passed!'
else:
    print 'Test 3 failed... try again!'
    
# Test case 3
example_labels = graphlab.SArray([-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1])
if intermediate_node_num_mistakes(example_labels) == 2:
    print 'Test passed!'
else:
    print 'Test 3 failed... try again!'</pre>
 <h3 level="3">
  Function to pick best feature to split on
 </h3>
 <p>
  The function
  <em>
   best_splitting_feature
  </em>
  takes 3 arguments:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    The data
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The features to consider for splits (a list of strings of column names to consider for splits)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The name of the target/label column (string)
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The function will loop through the list of possible features, and consider splitting on each of them. It will calculate the classification error of each split and return the feature that had the smallest classification error when split on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recall that the
  <strong>
   classification error
  </strong>
  is defined as follows:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$\mbox{classification error} = \dfrac{\mbox{# mistakes}}{\mbox{# total examples}}$$
 </p>
 <p>
  9. Follow these steps to implement
  <em>
   best_splitting_feature
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Step 1:
    </strong>
    Loop over each feature in the feature list
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Step 2:
    </strong>
    Within the loop, split the data into two groups: one group where all of the data has feature value 0 or False (we will call this the
    <strong>
     left
    </strong>
    split), and one group where all of the data has feature value 1 or True (we will call this the
    <strong>
     right
    </strong>
    split). Make sure the
    <strong>
     left
    </strong>
    split corresponds with 0 and the
    <strong>
     right
    </strong>
    split corresponds with 1 to ensure your implementation fits with our implementation of the tree building process.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Step 3:
    </strong>
    Calculate the number of misclassified examples in both groups of data and use the above formula to compute the
    <strong>
     classification error
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Step 4:
    </strong>
    If the computed error is smaller than the best error found so far, store this
    <strong>
     feature and its error
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Note:
  </strong>
  Remember that since we are only dealing with binary features, we do not have to consider thresholds for real-valued features. This makes the implementation of this function much easier.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your code should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def best_splitting_feature(data, features, target):
    
    target_values = data[target]
    best_feature = None # Keep track of the best feature 
    best_error = 10     # Keep track of the best error so far 
    # Note: Since error is always &lt;= 1, we should intialize it with something larger than 1.

    # Convert to float to make sure error gets computed correctly.
    num_data_points = float(len(data))  
    
    # Loop through each feature to consider splitting on that feature
    for feature in features:
        
        # The left split will have all data points where the feature value is 0
        left_split = data[data[feature] == 0]
        
        # The right split will have all data points where the feature value is 1
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        right_split =  
            
        # Calculate the number of misclassified examples in the left split.
        # Remember that we implemented a function for this! (It was called intermediate_node_num_mistakes)
        # YOUR CODE HERE
        left_mistakes =             

        # Calculate the number of misclassified examples in the right split.
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        right_mistakes = 
            
        # Compute the classification error of this split.
        # Error = (# of mistakes (left) + # of mistakes (right)) / (# of data points)
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        error = 

        # If this is the best error we have found so far, store the feature as best_feature and the error as best_error
        ## YOUR CODE HERE
        if error &lt; best_error:
        
    
    return best_feature # Return the best feature we found</pre>
 <h3 level="3">
  Building the tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  With the above functions implemented correctly, we are now ready to build our decision tree. Each node in the decision tree is represented as a dictionary which contains the following keys and possible values:
 </p>
 <pre language="plain_text">{ 
   'is_leaf'            : True/False.
   'prediction'         : Prediction at the leaf node.
   'left'               : (dictionary corresponding to the left tree).
   'right'              : (dictionary corresponding to the right tree).
   'splitting_feature'  : The feature that this node splits on
}
</pre>
 <p>
  10. First, we will write a function that creates a leaf node given a set of target values. Your code should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def create_leaf(target_values):    
    # Create a leaf node
    leaf = {'splitting_feature' : None,
            'left' : None,
            'right' : None,
            'is_leaf':     }   ## YOUR CODE HERE 
   
    # Count the number of data points that are +1 and -1 in this node.
    num_ones = len(target_values[target_values == +1])
    num_minus_ones = len(target_values[target_values == -1])    

    # For the leaf node, set the prediction to be the majority class.
    # Store the predicted class (1 or -1) in leaf['prediction']
    if num_ones &gt; num_minus_ones:
        leaf['prediction'] =          ## YOUR CODE HERE
    else:
        leaf['prediction'] =          ## YOUR CODE HERE        

    # Return the leaf node
    return leaf </pre>
 <p>
  We have provided a function that learns the decision tree recursively and implements 3 stopping conditions:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Stopping condition 1:
    </strong>
    All data points in a node are from the same class.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Stopping condition 2:
    </strong>
    No more features to split on.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Additional stopping condition:
    </strong>
    In addition to the above two stopping conditions covered in lecture, in this assignment we will also consider a stopping condition based on the
    <strong>
     max_depth
    </strong>
    of the tree. By not letting the tree grow too deep, we will save computational effort in the learning process.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  11. Now, we will provide a Python skeleton of the learning algorithm. Note that this code is not complete; it needs to be completed by you if you are using Python. Otherwise, your code should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def decision_tree_create(data, features, target, current_depth = 0, max_depth = 10):
    remaining_features = features[:] # Make a copy of the features.

 <h3 level="3">
  Build the tree!
 </h3>
 <p>
  12. Train a tree model on the
  <strong>
   train_data
  </strong>
  . Limit the depth to 6 (
  <strong>
   max_depth = 6
  </strong>
  ) to make sure the algorithm doesn't run for too long. Call this tree
  <strong>
   my_decision_tree
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   Warning
  </strong>
  : The tree may take 1-2 minutes to learn.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Making predictions with a decision tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  13. As discussed in the lecture, we can make predictions from the decision tree with a simple recursive function. Write a function called
  <em>
   classify
  </em>
  , which takes in a learned tree and a test point x to classify. Include an option annotate that describes the prediction path when set to True. Your code should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def classify(tree, x, annotate = False):
       # if the node is a leaf node.
    if tree['is_leaf']:
        if annotate:
             print "At leaf, predicting %s" % tree['prediction']
        return tree['prediction']
     else:
        # split on feature.
        split_feature_value = x[tree['splitting_feature']]
        if annotate:
             print "Split on %s = %s" % (tree['splitting_feature'], split_feature_value)
        if split_feature_value == 0:
            return classify(tree['left'], x, annotate)
        else:
               ### YOUR CODE HERE</pre>
 <p>
  14. Now, let's consider the first example of the test set and see what
  <strong>
   my_decision_tree
  </strong>
  model predicts for this data point.
 </p>
 <pre language="python">print test_data[0]
print 'Predicted class: %s ' % classify(my_decision_tree, test_data[0])
</pre>
 <p>
  15. Let's add some annotations to our prediction to see what the prediction path was that lead to this predicted class:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">classify(my_decision_tree, test_data[0], annotate=True)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz question
  </strong>
  : What was the feature that
  <strong>
   my_decision_tree
  </strong>
  first split on while making the prediction for test_data[0]?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz questio
  </strong>
  <strong>
   n
  </strong>
  : What was the first feature that lead to a right split of test_data[0]?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz question
  </strong>
  : What was the last feature split on before reaching a leaf node for test_data[0]?
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Evaluating your decision tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  16. Now, we will write a function to evaluate a decision tree by computing the classification error of the tree on the given dataset. Write a function called
  <em>
   evaluate_classification_error
  </em>
  that takes in as input:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    tree (as described above)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    data (a data frame of data points)
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  This function should return a prediction (class label) for each row in data using the decision tree. Your code should be analogous to
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def evaluate_classification_error(tree, data):
    # Apply the classify(tree, x) to each row in your data
    prediction = data.apply(lambda x: classify(tree, x))
    
    # Once you've made the predictions, calculate the classification error and return it
    ## YOUR CODE HERE
    </pre>
 <p>
  17. Now, use this function to evaluate the classification error on the test set.
 </p>
 <pre language="python">evaluate_classification_error(my_decision_tree, test_data)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz Question:
  </strong>
  Rounded to 2nd decimal point, what is the classification error of
  <strong>
   my_decision_tree
  </strong>
  on the
  <strong>
   test_data
  </strong>
  ?
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Printing out a decision stump
 </h3>
 <p>
  18. As discussed in the lecture, we can print out a single decision stump (printing out the entire tree is left as an exercise to the curious reader). Here we provide Python code to visualize a decision stump. If you are using different software, make sure your code is analogous to:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def print_stump(tree, name = 'root'):
    split_name = tree['splitting_feature'] # split_name is something like 'term. 36 months'
    if split_name is None:
        print "(leaf, label: %s)" % tree['prediction']
        return None
    split_feature, split_value = split_name.split('.')
    print '                       %s' % name
    print '         |---------------|----------------|'
    print '         |                                |'
    print '         |                                |'
    print '         |                                |'
    print '  [{0} == 0]               [{0} == 1]    '.format(split_name)
    print '         |                                |'
    print '         |                                |'
    print '         |                                |'
    print '    (%s)                         (%s)' \
        % (('leaf, label: ' + str(tree['left']['prediction']) if tree['left']['is_leaf'] else 'subtree'),
           ('leaf, label: ' + str(tree['right']['prediction']) if tree['right']['is_leaf'] else 'subtree'))</pre>
 <p>
  19. Using this function, we can print out the root of our decision tree:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">print_stump(my_decision_tree)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz Question:
  </strong>
  What is the feature that is used for the split at the root node?
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Exploring the intermediate left subtree
 </h3>
 <p>
  The tree is a recursive dictionary, so we do have access to all the nodes! We can use
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    my_decision_tree['left'] to go left
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    my_decision_tree['right'] to go right
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  20. We can print out the left subtree by running the code
 </p>
 <pre language="python">print_stump(my_decision_tree['left'], my_decision_tree['splitting_feature'])</pre>
 <p>
  We can similarly print out the left subtree of the left subtree of the root by running the code
 </p>
 <pre language="python">print_stump(my_decision_tree['left']['left'], my_decision_tree['left']['splitting_feature'])</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Quiz question
  </strong>
  : What is the path of the first 3 feature splits considered along the left-most branch of my_decision_tree?
