00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:07,610
Emily and I really hope you've
enjoyed the course so far.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,030
We've really explored the foundations
of machine learning on a wide range of

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,888
domains with a range of
different applications.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,560
And really touched many of the practical
issues around deploying and

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,590
building machine learning systems.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,960
And now in this closing module we're going
to really summarize some of the concepts

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,660
that we've learned.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,700
Talk about how to deploy these ideas,

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,100
especially machine learning
systems in production and

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,700
then what's ahead in the specialization
and in machine learning as a whole.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,498
Some really exciting stuff as
we close off this first course.
