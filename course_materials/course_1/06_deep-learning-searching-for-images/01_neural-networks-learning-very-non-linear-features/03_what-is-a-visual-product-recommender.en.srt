2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:07,080
There are many ways to shop for
products today.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,510
Typically though, you have to use
what's called keyword search.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,110
You type a query on a search engine and

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,860
try to find products that
are interesting to you.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,450
But let's look at new ways to shop.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,610
So for example, let's say I want to
buy a shoe, or buy a pair of shoes.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,570
Now some people just really care about
shoes, I really care about shoes.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,830
I have, let's say,
this cool black pair of shoes.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,510
It's got some real style to it.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,710
I have this other black pair of shoes.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,130
It might look to you as most the same, but

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,090
they're totally different,
totally different styles.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,950
I have this crazy dress shoe.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,370
They might look transparent to you, but
it's actually a really cool shade of blue.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,210
I have this crazy,
two-colored sneakers, which I love.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,460
I also have this other really
interesting pair of sneakers,

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,330
which I bought in Hong Kong,
and they're kind of fun.

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,050
And everybody knows I like purple,
so I even have this purple boots.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,930
>> Forget it, you have a lot of shoes.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,470
>> I have a lot of shoes,
but I need more shoes.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,770
And so, there's a lot of shoes online.

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,723
And it's really hard to find the ones
that are interesting, stylish, different,

24
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:19,060
kind of like my style.

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,330
And if I use keyword search,
it doesn't really help me.

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,140
If I have to type the dress shoes,
I just find a bunch of boring usual shoes.

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,162
Although the ones on
the top left-hand corner,

28
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:31,910
they're kind of interesting and stylish.

29
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,100
But still,
I want to find something different, and

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,590
I don't know what keywords to type or
how to search for it.

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,702
So, what should I do?

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,223
Let me start by showing you a cool
demo of a new way to shop based on

33
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,680
similarity search.

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,400
Let's talk about something even
more complicated than buying shoes.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,170
My sister is a fashion designer and
her birthday's coming up.

36
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,730
And I want to buy her
a really interesting,

37
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,100
cool gift that she might love.

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,180
Well maybe I wanna buy her a dress.

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,940
So if I just use textual keyword
search and I try to look for

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,850
a dress,
I'm gonna find a bunch of dresses.

41
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,600
But I really don't know how to
choose a dress that she'll like

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,350
just based on these properties here.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
And I don't know how to describe it.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,340
How do you describe the dress
my sister might like?

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,140
Now, I could say maybe
she loves floral dresses.

46
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,186
Even if I say floral dresses, I'm still
presented with a number of options

47
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:39,460
in different kinds of floral dresses,
and her style is pretty unique.

48
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,199
So how am I gonna find a dress that really
looks like something she will love?

49
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,970
So if I scroll down this list, maybe
I'll see something that catches my eye.

50
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,080
Oh here's a floral dress that looks
pretty good, so I'm gonna click on that.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,852
And instead of just finding
dresses based on keyword search,

52
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:01,270
I wanna use image similarity
to find similar dresses.

53
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,380
So this are dresses that look similar to
this one, just based on image qualities.

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,340
And you see that now we get dresses
that do have similar properties.

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,530
And now, this is much easier to to kind
of find something that she might like.

56
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,930
But of course, many of these
dresses are a little too usual.

57
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,290
And she might want something
a little bit more interesting.

58
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,360
So for example,
here's one which has multiple patterns.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,020
And now we find dresses that are similar.

60
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,880
And you see they have multiple
styles within a dress.

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
How will I know how to describe that?

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,240
So let me search within the set.

63
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,350
And say, oh, you know what,
this one looks pretty good.

64
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,319
And if I click on that, you see other
visually similar dresses to this one,

65
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,400
but this one looks particularly good.

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,640
And the more I looks a little bit like
my sister too, so perfect gift for her.

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,619
