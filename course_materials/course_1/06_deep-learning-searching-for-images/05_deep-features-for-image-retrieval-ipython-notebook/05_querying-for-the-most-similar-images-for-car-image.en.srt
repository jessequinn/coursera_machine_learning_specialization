2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:07,885
So now that we have created
these helper functions,

3
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:10,700
let's do this for another image here.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,150
This is one that I cheated a little bit,
I found a car, and

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,050
then we'll just try a few examples.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:25,250
So we found a car and this car is
image train and its the eighth image.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,820
So, I just went image by
image to find the car.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:34,123
And then, just so
that you can see let's take the car image,

9
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:42,050
car image dot show and we'll see
the actual car we're talking about.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,180
And this is a red car.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,960
You see it right here, red car.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,120
The question is who are the nearest
neighbours for that car.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,120
And that was this command
that we did over here,

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,820
get_images_from_ids where
we query the car.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,010
But I am gonna kinda shortcut
things a little bit.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,676
So I'm going to say get_images_from_ids,

17
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:11,632
where I'm going to take my knn_model and

18
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:16,220
give it as input, the car image.

19
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,060
So knn_model,
I'm going to query that current image

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,800
and the output is going to be a list,
an s frame, and

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,230
then I'm going to select the image
column of the s frame and

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm gonna type .show in it.

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,502
And now, after I do this, you see
the input car was this red car, and

24
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:43,574
now we have a bunch of red
cars as near as eight.

25
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:45,350
So this is really cool.

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,418
In a few lines we built an example of
nearest neighbors for a car and for a cat.

27
