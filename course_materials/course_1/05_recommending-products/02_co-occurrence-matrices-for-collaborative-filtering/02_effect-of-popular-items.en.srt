2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,099
One issue, though, that we have with these
co-occurrence matrices is the fact that

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,710
they have to be normalized.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,840
Because let's talk about what happens
if we have a very popular item.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,130
So one of the most popular items for
babies is diapers.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,500
There are lots of these around here.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,430
They're very,
very useful when you have a baby.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,561
So basically, if you're gonna
purchase any baby item on Amazon,

9
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,711
you're also very likely at some
point to have purchased diapers.

10
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,470
But then let's look at some other item.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,910
This is Sophie the giraffe.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,970
It's actually one of the most
gifted items on Amazon for babies.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,830
But it's a little teether.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,372
Little babies like to bite on this.

15
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:52,214
It's rubbery.

16
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:53,500
It squeaks.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,780
Keeps them very interested.

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,040
But let's think about what happens
when we're looking at this other item.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,320
So we just purchased Sophie the Giraffe,
and we wanna make recommendations for

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,330
this person who just purchased
this little toy here.

21
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,470
So what I'm gonna look at is I'm gonna
look at the counts vector for Sophie.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,030
This is for Sophie the Giraffe.

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,780
And again we have that DVD that nobody's
purchasing, then we have diapers,

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,676
then we have baby

25
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:34,350
wipes, and
all the other products you can imagine.

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,600
And diapers is some enormous number.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,350
Let's say 1 million.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,070
Maybe that's not so enormous.

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,610
But 1 million.

30
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,870
It sounds pretty big, or
it used to sound pretty big.

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,090
So what ends up happening is that
regardless of what product I'm looking at,

32
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,800
regardless of whether I just
purchased Sophie the Giraffe.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Or if I just purchased
this little stacking toy.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,915
Or if I just purchased
this really cute alligator

35
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:09,770
that makes this sound and it rattles.

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,990
No matter what I just purchased, according
to the process that we just described,

37
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,090
I'm really,
really likely to recommend diapers to you.

38
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,350
So let's think about how to make
the recommendations a little bit more

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,980
personalized and have the effect that
everybody buying diapers doesn't

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,480
mean that that's what I'm particularly
interested in when I just bought Sophie.

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,090
So let's talk about how to handle this.

42
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,560
So this is just to reiterate what I
was saying, which is the fact that

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,740
having these very large counts for popular
items, drowns out all the other effects.

44
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,684
And so, we're just going back to this
default thing of recommending based off of

45
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:54,374
popularity, which is
what we were trying to

46
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,170
address with these different
types of recommender systems.

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,870
