الموسيقى So you guys have worked really
hard on this regression course and we've learned a lot of
really important concepts. Not only have you learned about regression
models but you've also learned how to use them, how to implement them, how to
deploy them in practice and so now with this methods, you can go out there and
solve a lot of really important problems. And in addition some of
the concepts that we've learned are gonna carry over throughout
the rest of the specialization, are really foundational
machine learning concepts. >> Regression is widely
used in many domains. >> Wait, wait. I wanted to say, if you missed his
Brazilian accent, Carlos is back. Ta dah. And he looks so
refreshed after that nice vacation. But you'll see a lot more
of him in the next course. (ضحك) (ضحك) So reaction is useful in a wide range of occupations from forecasting. >> You see how rested he looks? [LAUGH]
>> From forecasting how many products somebody will buy, to predicting the stock
market so you can be really rich. Now the techniques you learn here are
going to allow you to build the kind of intelligent applications that really
making a difference in the real world. So, we hope to see you in the entire
specialization as we go through classifiers, and recommender systems,
and document retrievals, all the way to building cool
recommender systems with deep learning. >> So, see you soon. >> See you soon. [ضحك] الموسيقى
