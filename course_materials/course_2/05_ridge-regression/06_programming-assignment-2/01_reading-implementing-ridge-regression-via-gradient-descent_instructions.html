 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1.
  </strong>
  If you’re using SFrame, import GraphLab Create and load in the house data as follows:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">sales = graphlab.SFrame('kc_house_data.gl/')</pre>
 <p>
  Otherwise, load all the three csv files.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2.
  </strong>
  If you’re using Python: to do the matrix operations required to perform a gradient descent we will be using the popular python library ‘numpy’ which is a computational library specialized for operations on arrays. For students unfamiliar with numpy we have created a numpy tutorial (see useful resources). It is common to import numpy under the name ‘np’ for short, to do this execute:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">import numpy as np</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3.
  </strong>
  Next, from Module 2, copy and paste the ‘get_numpy_data’ function (or equivalent) that takes a dataframe, a list of features (e.g. [‘sqft_living’, ‘bedrooms’]), to be used as inputs, and a name of the output (e.g. ‘price’). This function returns a ‘feature_matrix’ (2D array) consisting of first a column of ones followed by columns containing the values of the input features in the data set in the same order as the input list. It alsos return an ‘output_array’ which is an array of the values of the output in the data set (e.g. ‘price’).
 </p>
 <p>
  e.g. in Python:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def get_numpy_data(data_sframe, features, output):
    ...
    return (feature_matrix, output_array)</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4.
  </strong>
  Similarly, copy and paste the ‘predict_output’ function (or equivalent) from Module 2. This function accepts a 2D array ‘feature_matrix’ and a 1D array ‘weights’ and return a 1D array ‘predictions’.
 </p>
 <p>
  e.g. in Python:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def predict_output(feature_matrix, weights):
    ...
    return predictions</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5.
  </strong>
  We are now going to move to computing the derivative of the regression cost function. Recall that the cost function is the sum over the data points of the squared difference between an observed output and a predicted output, plus the L2 penalty term.
 </p>
 <pre language="python">Cost(w)
= SUM[ (prediction - output)^2 ]
+ l2_penalty*(w[0]^2 + w[1]^2 + ... + w[k]^2).</pre>
 <p>
  Since the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, we can take the derivative of the first part (the RSS) as we did in the notebook for the unregularized case in Module 2 and add the derivative of the regularization part. As we saw, the derivative of the RSS with respect to w[i] can be written as:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">2*SUM[ error*[feature_i] ]</pre>
 <p>
  The derivative of the regularization term with respect to w[i] is:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">2*l2_penalty*w[i]</pre>
 <p>
  Summing both, we get
 </p>
 <pre language="python">2*SUM[ error*[feature_i] ] + 2*l2_penalty*w[i]</pre>
 <p>
  That is, the derivative for the weight for feature i is the sum (over data points) of 2 times the product of the error and the feature itself, plus 2*l2_penalty*w[i].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   IMPORTANT: We will not regularize the constant.
  </strong>
  Thus, in the case of the constant, the derivative is just twice the sum of the errors (without the 2*l2_penalty*w[0] term).
 </p>
 <p>
  Recall that twice the sum of the product of two vectors is just twice the dot product of the two vectors. Therefore the derivative for the weight for feature_i is just two times the dot product between the values of feature_i and the current errors, plus 2*l2_penalty*w[i].
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   6.
  </strong>
  With this in mind write the derivative function which computes the derivative of the weight given the value of the feature (over all data points) and the errors (over all data points). To decide when to we are dealing with the constant (so we don't regularize it) we added the extra parameter to the call ‘feature_is_constant’ which you should set to True when computing the derivative of the constant and False otherwise.
 </p>
 <p>
  e.g. in Python:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def feature_derivative_ridge(errors, feature, weight, l2_penalty, feature_is_constant):
    ...
    return derivative</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   7.
  </strong>
  To test your feature derivative function, run the following:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">(example_features, example_output) = get_numpy_data(sales, ['sqft_living'], 'price')
my_weights = np.array([1., 10.])
test_predictions = predict_output(example_features, my_weights)
errors = test_predictions - example_output # prediction errors

# next two lines should print the same values
print feature_derivative_ridge(errors, example_features[:,1], my_weights[1], 1, False)
print np.sum(errors*example_features[:,1])*2+20.
print ''

# next two lines should print the same values
print feature_derivative_ridge(errors, example_features[:,0], my_weights[0], 1, True)
print np.sum(errors)*2.</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   8.
  </strong>
  Now we will write a function that performs a gradient descent. The basic premise is simple. Given a starting point we update the current weights by moving in the negative gradient direction. Recall that the gradient is the direction of increase and therefore the negative gradient is the direction of decrease and we're trying to minimize a cost function.
 </p>
 <p>
  The amount by which we move in the negative gradient direction is called the ‘step size’. We stop when we are ‘sufficiently close’ to the optimum. Unlike in Module 2, this time we will set a maximum number of iterations and take gradient steps until we reach this maximum number. If no maximum number is supplied, the maximum should be set 100 by default. (Use default parameter values in Python.)
 </p>
 <p>
  With this in mind, write a gradient descent function using your derivative function above. For each step in the gradient descent, we update the weight for each feature before computing our stopping criteria.  The function will take the following parameters:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    2D feature matrix
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    array of output values
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    initial weights
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    step size
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    L2 penalty
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    maximum number of iterations
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  To make your job easier, we provide a skeleton in Python:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">def ridge_regression_gradient_descent(feature_matrix, output, initial_weights, step_size, l2_penalty, max_iterations=100):
    weights = np.array(initial_weights) # make sure it's a numpy array
        #while not reached maximum number of iterations:
        # compute the predictions using your predict_output() function

        # compute the errors as predictions - output
        for i in xrange(len(weights)): # loop over each weight
            # Recall that feature_matrix[:,i] is the feature column associated with weights[i]
            # compute the derivative for weight[i].
            #(Remember: when i=0, you are computing the derivative of the constant!)

            # subtract the step size times the derivative from the current weight  
              return weights
</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
  The L2 penalty gets its name because it causes weights to have small L2 norms than otherwise. Let's see how large weights get penalized. Let us consider a simple model with 1 feature.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    features: ‘sqft_living’
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    output: ‘price’
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   10.
  </strong>
  Split the dataset into training set and test set. If you are using GraphLab Create, call
 </p>
 <pre language="python">train_data,test_data = sales.random_split(.8,seed=0)</pre>
 <p>
  Otherwise, please download the csv files from the download section.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   11.
  </strong>
  Convert the training set and test set using the ‘get_numpy_data’ function.e.g. in Python:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">simple_features = ['sqft_living']
my_output = 'price'
(simple_feature_matrix, output) = get_numpy_data(train_data, simple_features, my_output)
(simple_test_feature_matrix, test_output) = get_numpy_data(test_data, simple_features, my_output)
</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>

  First, let’s consider no regularization. Set the L2 penalty to 0.0 and run your ridge regression algorithm to learn the weights of the simple model (described above). Use the following parameters:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    step_size = 1e-12
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    max_iterations = 1000
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    initial_weights = all zeros
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Store the learned weights as
 </p>
 <pre language="python">simple_weights_0_penalty</pre>
 <p>
  we’ll use them later.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   13.
  </strong>
  Next, let’s consider high regularization. Set the L2 penalty to 1e11 and run your ridge regression to learn the weights of the simple model. Use the same parameters as above. Call your weights:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">simple_weights_high_penalty</pre>
 <p>
  we’ll use them later.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   14.
  </strong>
  If you have access to matplotlib, the following piece of code will plot the two learned models. (The blue line is for the model with no regularization and the red line is for the one with high regularization.)
 </p>
 <pre language="python">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
plt.plot(simple_feature_matrix,output,'k.',
        simple_feature_matrix,predict_output(simple_feature_matrix, simple_weights_0_penalty),'b-',
        simple_feature_matrix,predict_output(simple_feature_matrix, simple_weights_high_penalty),'r-')</pre>
 <p>
  If you do not have access to matplotlib, look at each set of coefficients. If you were to plot ‘sqft_living’ vs the price, which of the two coefficients is the slope and which is the intercept?
