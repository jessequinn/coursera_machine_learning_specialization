[MUSIC] Emily and I really hope you've
enjoyed the course so far. We've really explored the foundations
of machine learning on a wide range of domains with a range of
different applications. And really touched many of the practical
issues around deploying and building machine learning systems. And now in this closing module we're going
to really summarize some of the concepts that we've learned. Talk about how to deploy these ideas, especially machine learning
systems in production and then what's ahead in the specialization
and in machine learning as a whole. Some really exciting stuff as
we close off this first course. [MUSIC]
