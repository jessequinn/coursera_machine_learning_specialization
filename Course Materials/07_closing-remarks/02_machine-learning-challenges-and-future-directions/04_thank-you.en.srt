00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:06,353
So we hope you've enjoyed this
first course in this machine

3
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:09,588
learning specialization, and not only
have you learned a lot of different

4
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:13,660
machine learning methods, but
you've actually put them into practice.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,210
>> And we really appreciate your effort.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,160
We know you've worked really hard, you've
implemented a lot of different machine

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,350
learning algorithms, and
really gone through those notebooks.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,180
And really understood not just
the concepts, but how to put them

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,050
into practice and really how to evaluate
whether those models that you built

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,210
really work and provide the value that
you expect out of machine learning.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,260
Now you're ready to build your
own intelligent applications and

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,890
really apply them in practice.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,060
>> But there's a lot more ahead for us in
this specialization to turn you guys into

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,455
machine learning experts, where you can
actually design and deploy new methods.

15
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:57,434
[LAUGH]
Was there more I was supposed to say?

16
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,550
>> Or am I saying that?

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,650
>> Oh.

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,826
Let's both be excited.

19
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,257
We're all excited.

20
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:06,770
>> [LAUGH]
>> We're both excited for this journey

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,405
that you have ahead with us in this
specialization, it'll be very meaningful.

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,890
>> [LAUGH] It's really
cool to have you join us,

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,650
thank you for coming to the first course.

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,340
We're excited to see you in
the following courses, and

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,425
see the amazing things you're gonna build
in the capstone project at the end.

26
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,190
>> [LAUGH]
>> Thank you for your hard work.

27
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,976
>> Thank you, see you soon.
