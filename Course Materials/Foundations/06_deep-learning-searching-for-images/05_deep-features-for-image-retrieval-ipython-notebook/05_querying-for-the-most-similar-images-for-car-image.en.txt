[MUSIC] So now that we have created
these helper functions, let's do this for another image here. This is one that I cheated a little bit,
I found a car, and then we'll just try a few examples. So we found a car and this car is
image train and its the eighth image. So, I just went image by
image to find the car. And then, just so
that you can see let's take the car image, car image dot show and we'll see
the actual car we're talking about. And this is a red car. You see it right here, red car. The question is who are the nearest
neighbours for that car. And that was this command
that we did over here, get_images_from_ids where
we query the car. But I am gonna kinda shortcut
things a little bit. So I'm going to say get_images_from_ids, where I'm going to take my knn_model and give it as input, the car image. So knn_model,
I'm going to query that current image and the output is going to be a list,
an s frame, and then I'm going to select the image
column of the s frame and I'm gonna type .show in it. And now, after I do this, you see
the input car was this red car, and now we have a bunch of red
cars as near as eight. So this is really cool. In a few lines we built an example of
nearest neighbors for a car and for a cat. [MUSIC]
