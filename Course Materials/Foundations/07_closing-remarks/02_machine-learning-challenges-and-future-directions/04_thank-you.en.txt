[MUSIC] So we hope you've enjoyed this
first course in this machine learning specialization, and not only
have you learned a lot of different machine learning methods, but
you've actually put them into practice. >> And we really appreciate your effort. We know you've worked really hard, you've
implemented a lot of different machine learning algorithms, and
really gone through those notebooks. And really understood not just
the concepts, but how to put them into practice and really how to evaluate
whether those models that you built really work and provide the value that
you expect out of machine learning. Now you're ready to build your
own intelligent applications and really apply them in practice. >> But there's a lot more ahead for us in
this specialization to turn you guys into machine learning experts, where you can
actually design and deploy new methods. [LAUGH]
Was there more I was supposed to say? >> Or am I saying that? >> Oh. Let's both be excited. We're all excited. >> [LAUGH]
>> We're both excited for this journey that you have ahead with us in this
specialization, it'll be very meaningful. >> [LAUGH] It's really
cool to have you join us, thank you for coming to the first course. We're excited to see you in
the following courses, and see the amazing things you're gonna build
in the capstone project at the end. >> [LAUGH]
>> Thank you for your hard work. >> Thank you, see you soon. [MUSIC]
