  Discussion Forums
 </h3>
 <p>
  Most courses on Coursera include a set of discussion forums, accessible by clicking on the “Discussions” item in the menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  The discussion forums are a great place to get help if you’re stuck, get to know other learners working through the course alongside you, and take your understanding to a deeper level by discussing course materials with your peers. Feel free to start new threads, respond to other people’s posts, and follow or upvote posts that you find helpful or interesting. Remember to keep your posts appropriate, relevant to the course, and helpful to your classmates. Here are five tips that can help you contribute to a healthy and vibrant forum experience:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Upvote posts that are helpful and interesting. This is the best way to ensure that quality posts will be seen by other learners in the course.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If asking a question, be specific. Provide as much information as possible, what you’ve already considered, what you’ve already read, etc.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Use the filters at the top of the forum page (Latest, Top, and Unanswered) to find active, interesting content.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all personal attacks. For more information see Coursera’s

  Mentors
 </h3>
 <p>
  Many Coursera courses also have a small team of Mentors (identifiable by a green “Mentor” badge next to their name on posts they’ve written) dedicated to supporting learners as they progress through the course. Mentors are selected from learners who have previously passed the course with a high grade, and been particularly helpful to other learners in the forums. If you’re struggling with part of the course or need some help using Coursera, Mentors are the perfect people to ask!
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentors are volunteers selected by Coursera and do not represent the Institution that created the course.

  Become a Mentor
 </h3>
 <p>
  We are always looking for new Mentors to support new courses and to replace retiring Mentors. If you think you would enjoy helping others out, moderating the forums, and encouraging deeper discussions of the subject, we would love to have you on board as a Mentor! For more details about becoming a Mentor, please check out the file below:
