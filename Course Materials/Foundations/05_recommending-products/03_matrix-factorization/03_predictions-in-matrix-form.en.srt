[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:09,070
Okay, so let's take these ratings
that we were just talking about.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,380
And instead of talking about them for
a specific combination of a movie and

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,710
a user, let's talk about how we can think
about representing our predictions over

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,180
the entire set of users and movies.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,130
And to do this, we're gonna need
a little bit of linear algebra.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,610
So in particular, if we're looking
at the score that we're giving

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,220
to a specific movie, v, for a user, u.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,711
So this is rating [BLANK AUDIO]

10
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:45,848
predicted for user u and movie v.

11
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,300
Well, what did we say that was?

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,425
We said we took the user vector Lu,
and we took the movie vector Rv,

13
00:00:55,425 --> 00:01:00,136
and we did this element-wise product, and

14
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:04,740
summed over the elements of that product.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,410
So I'm gonna denote that just
with this little notation here.

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,210
So these little braces here mean
we're gonna take the vector Lu and

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,120
the vector Rv,
do an element-wise product, and sum.

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,140
Okay, so
what that represents is we're taking a row

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,830
of a big matrix L, so
there's a row that has a vector Lu.

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,640
So let me write this a little
bit more largely here,

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,570
so this row Lu is the vector
that we talked about before.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,820
With how much that user likes
different things like action,

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,380
romance, and so on, and

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,920
then we take a movie vector, Rv.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,410
So again,
we'll write it more largely here.

26
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,250
So Rv is indexed over
the same set of genres, or

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,170
topics, for the movie, and
has some set of entries.

28
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,010
And in this matrix notation,

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,270
if you're familiar with matrix multiply,
to get the entry.

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,560
So this is the uth row here,
and the vth column here.

31
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,510
If we multiply these together, we get
the uvth entry of this resulting matrix.

32
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,830
So if you're not familiar with
this kind of thing, that's okay.

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,110
We're gonna talk about
it in a lot more detail.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,826
In subsequent courses,
but for those who are,

35
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:51,708
this representation is a very compact
way to take all of the vectors for

36
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:57,089
all of the users, so
we're stacking up all of the user vectors,

37
00:02:57,089 --> 00:03:00,600
and stacking up all of the movie vectors.

38
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:06,421
And through this representation,

39
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:12,560
we end up with an entire matrix which
is just like we were writing before.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,760
It's a users by movies matrix.

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,736
So all of the users that
appeared here [BLANK

42
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:26,660
AUDIO] are appearing here,
and all of the movies

43
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,740
that appeared as columns here
are appearing as columns in this matrix.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,818
And each individual entry, again,
is a combination of a specific

45
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:41,581
row of this L matrix and
a specific column of this matrix R here.

00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:45,699
