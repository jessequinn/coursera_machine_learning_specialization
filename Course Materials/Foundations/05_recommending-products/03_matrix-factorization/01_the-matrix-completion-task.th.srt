2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,272
So in the co-occurence approaches
we've been talking about so

3
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:12,473
far, there's been no notion of
different aspects of me as a user or

4
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:17,240
features of the product that
are driving the recommendations made.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,040
Instead we're simply counting
co-occurences of purchases and

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,910
user histories.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,090
So a natural question is whether
we can somehow use some aspects of

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,050
who I am and what a product is
to drive the recommendations

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,020
just like we talked about in
the classification approach, so

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,830
we have some set of features for
the user and the product.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,540
But here, we'd like to be able to
learn these features from the data.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,260
That'll help us cope with
the problems we talked about

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,140
where we might not have
features available.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,880
In addition, we'd like to take into
account interactions between users and

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,630
items just like we did in the co-occurance
application or the co-occurance approach.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,510
So we're going to discuss this in
the context of a movie recommendation task

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,400
because it's very intuitive to
talk about this application for

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,580
the methods that we're gonna describe.

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,720
And in this application, what we have
as our data is we have this big table

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,830
where we have a whole bunch of users that
are watching some set of movies, and

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,090
they rate those movies, okay?

22
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,860
So, our table looks something like this,
where this green user went on, watched

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,860
three different movies, gave them a rating
of three stars, five stars, and two stars.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,950
And then there was this blue user,
watched two different movies, and

25
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,300
this pink user,
watched four different movies.

26
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,680
And we have a very big table of the user,
movie, ratings combinations.

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,950
However, each user only watches
a few of the available movies.

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,813
So we're gonna transform this data table
into a really big users by movies matrix

29
00:01:58,813 --> 00:01:59,607
of ratings.

30
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:04,144
And the reason it's a really big matrix in
general is there tend to be a lot of users

31
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:05,730
and a lot of movies.

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,798
But at the same time,
this matrix is very sparse.

33
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:14,210
Because there are lots and lots of movies
and even though there are a lot of users,

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,670
there's only a few movies that
any given user has watched.

35
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,690
And so, if we look at this matrix that
like I said is a users by movies matrix,

36
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,720
then let's say for
example this row represents user u and

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,210
this column represents movie v.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:41,740
Well, this black square here represents
the rating that user u gave to movie v.

39
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,809
So this is rating of

40
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:53,930
movie v by user u.

41
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,990
So there are few of these black squares,
but there are lots and

42
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,120
lots of these white squares.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,140
So what a white square
represents is a question mark.

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,660
It's a case where a user
has not watched a movie or

45
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,230
at least has not provided a rating for
that movie.

46
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,950
And so I just want to be clear that
all the white squares represent

47
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,170
unknown ratings.

48
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,030
They don't represent ratings of zero.

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,380
It's not that the user
did not like that movie.

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,720
It's just that we don't know what
the user thinks about that movie.

51
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:35,650
Okay, so we're going to say that
rating(u,v) is the rating that user u

52
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,650
gave to movie v and
it's known for the black squares,

53
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,299
those are cases were we have the ratings,
and it's unknown for the white cells.

54
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,160
And our goal here is to fill in all these
question marks, all these white cells.

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,090
And the way we're gonna do
this is we're gonna take all

56
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,640
the ratings that the user has provided,
so all the black squares for that user.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,590
So let me switch colors quickly here.

58
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:11,380
So we would take all of these ratings
provided by this user and use these

59
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,930
to predict what the rating is for
these questions marks.

60
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,005
Actually, all of these question
marks we're gonna fill

61
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:28,830
in using that user's history as
well as those of all other users.

62
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,650
โอเค

63
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,090
So we're taking, this is the history
of ratings of that user and

64
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,110
every other user, and using it to predict

65
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,970
how much we think they're gonna like
this movie that they haven't watched.

66
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,110
So let me just be very clear.

67
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,470
This is, we're filling in a question mark.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,500
And I just really wanna reiterate that
we're not just using the ratings of this

69
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,030
user, but we're using all of these ratings
when we're going to make that prediction.

70
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,808
And I won't bore you by drawing little
magenta boxes around every black cell.

71
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:13,142
But just know that's all the information
we're using to fill in this

72
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:14,472
really big sparse matrix.

73
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:18,579
