2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,310
Okay.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,010
So I have a question for you guys which
is, how would you maximize recall?

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,580
Remember recall.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,590
We just look at the magenta squares.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,380
We look at the liked items.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,610
And we measure how many of my liked
items were actually retrieved or

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,780
actually recommended to me.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,920
Well, as the title answers, there's
a very easy way to maximize recall.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,520
Just recommend everything.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,550
If you recommend everything,

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,010
you're guaranteed to recommend
the products that I like.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,420
So in this case what would recall be?

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,840
It would just be 1, because all 5 of
the products I liked were recommended.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,260
So this is because there are 5
out of 5 products recommended.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,480
But what's the resulting
precision of doing this?

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,670
Well, it can actually
be arbitrarily small.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,707
Because if you have tons and tons and
tons of products out there, and

19
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:04,240
if I like only a very,
very small number of them,

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,780
then if you recommend everything,
I'm gonna have very small precision.

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,512
So let's just say this is small and
maybe very small.

22
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,100
So that's not really a great strategy.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,740
On the other hand,
what would be the optimal recommender?

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,600
What's the best recommender
you can imagine?

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,261
Well, the best recommender
is one that recommends all

26
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:41,180
the products I like but
only the products I like.

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,970
So everything that was not liked
was never shown by the recommender.

28
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,580
So that would be great.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,710
No wasted effort,

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,870
capture everything I like, gonna make lots
of money with this recommender system.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,700
What's the precision and recall?

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,220
Both are 1 in this case.

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,585
And you can go through and

34
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:05,840
verify that using the equations
from the previous slides.

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,149
