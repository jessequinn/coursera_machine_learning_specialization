[MUSIC] Okay. So I have a question for you guys which
is, how would you maximize recall? Remember recall. We just look at the magenta squares. We look at the liked items. And we measure how many of my liked
items were actually retrieved or actually recommended to me. Well, as the title answers, there's
a very easy way to maximize recall. Just recommend everything. If you recommend everything, you're guaranteed to recommend
the products that I like. So in this case what would recall be? It would just be 1, because all 5 of
the products I liked were recommended. So this is because there are 5
out of 5 products recommended. But what's the resulting
precision of doing this? Well, it can actually
be arbitrarily small. Because if you have tons and tons and
tons of products out there, and if I like only a very,
very small number of them, then if you recommend everything,
I'm gonna have very small precision. So let's just say this is small and
maybe very small. So that's not really a great strategy. On the other hand,
what would be the optimal recommender? What's the best recommender
you can imagine? Well, the best recommender
is one that recommends all the products I like but
only the products I like. So everything that was not liked
was never shown by the recommender. So that would be great. No wasted effort, capture everything I like, gonna make lots
of money with this recommender system. What's the precision and recall? Both are 1 in this case. And you can go through and verify that using the equations
from the previous slides. [MUSIC]
