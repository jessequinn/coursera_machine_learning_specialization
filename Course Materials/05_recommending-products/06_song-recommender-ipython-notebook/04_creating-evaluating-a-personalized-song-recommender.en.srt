2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:08,995
Now, in contrast,
let's make it more personalized,

3
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:14,880
a model that's more personalized,
as Emily, described.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,201
So, next we are gonna build a a song

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,969
recommender with personalization.

6
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,433
So let's call it personalize_model and

7
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:34,271
all we're gonna do is repeat the line

8
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:38,953
that we had earlier so graphlab.,

9
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:44,259
instead of being the popularity model,

10
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:50,346
let's use the item similarity recommender,

11
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:58,610
so remember we talked about
item similarity in the module.

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,580
We can do a item_similarity.create.

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,400
And let's see what happens.

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,075
So here, just like before,
we had to give it train_data.

15
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:16,120
We have to tell it what
the user_id column is called,

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,014
which in this case was user_id.

17
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,560
And you had to tell it what the item_id
column in this case which is called song.

18
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,700
So instead of the popularity model we
now built an item_similarity model.

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,650
And here we go it's done.

20
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,632
So let's start applying it.

21
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:46,896
So, applying the personalized

22
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:54,052
model to make song recommendations.

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,360
And here we go, let's apply it.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,690
So let's start with the couple
of users that we had before.

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,796
So for example if you take
the personalized model,

26
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:13,050
personalized_model and we call recommend

27
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,024
on that for that first user so users of 0.

28
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:22,906
You'll see that no longer
does it recommend Bjork and

29
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:27,027
a few of those others that everybody got,
but

30
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:31,802
recommended Dr.
Feelgood, Elizeth Cardoso, and

31
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:36,811
then the Brazilian song,
Ween, Subhumans and so on.

32
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:41,530
It's kind of an interesting thing so
pretty cool.

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,060
Let's see what user one got
because it's a personalized_model.

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,727
So personalized_model.recommend for users.

35
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:56,800
And again it's a list but I'm just gonna
put one element in the list, so user 1.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,860
And you'll see that now it recommends
something totally different.

37
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,830
Florence and the Machine,

38
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,115
and somehow this user really
likes Florence and the Machine.

39
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:11,280
[LAUGH] It just recommends that again,
again, again, again, again.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,960
And Apocalyptica and so on.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,630
So as you can see,
now the model is really personalized.

42
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,380
And you can do some really fun things
with it because it's personalized.

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,730
Not only can you say for
a particular user, what songs,

44
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,930
other songs they should listen to,
just like we did in recommendations.

45
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,120
But we can also take a song and

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,450
ask what other songs are similar,
are liked by similar people.

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,460
So people who like the song
also like this other song, so

48
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,424
we can do that by
personalized_model.get_similar_items.

49
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:49,971
So get similar items, you give it a list
of items, and it finds similar ones.

50
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:53,348
So for example,

51
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:59,620
if I really love the song with or

52
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,728
Without You by U2.

53
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:08,400
I really actually like this song,
it's pretty cool.

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,820
You'll see other songs
it recommends all by U2,

55
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,980
I Still Haven't Found What I'm
Looking For, Hold Me, Thrill Me,

56
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,230
Kiss Me, Kill Me,
Window in the Skies, Vertigo,

57
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,290
Sunday Bloody Sunday, Bad, A Day Without
Me, Another Place Another Place,

58
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,380
Walk On, Walk On's a nice song,
Get On Your Boots, so all U2 songs.

59
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,150
So if you like one U2 song, you like
other U2 songs, that's pretty typical.

60
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,320
Now another thing that I enjoy,
so if I take this

61
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,720
very similar model and
I am gonna get similar items.

62
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,050
So we can get all similar users.

63
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,320
For a user to find other users
that like this one, like her.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,570
But here we are gonna
get similar items and

65
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,140
the list I'm gonna give
is a little different.

66
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,860
So this is another song I kinda like.

67
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,810
It's called Chan Chan and
I like the live version.

68
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:12,684
And it is by Buena Vista Social Club.

69
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:17,000
Now if you don't know this song,
if you know the Buena Vista Social Club,

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,070
you should it's awesome,
awesome really, cool.

71
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,980
So if you like Chan Chan,
by Buena Vista Social Club, a Cuban band,

72
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,830
you also might like other
Buena Vista Social Club songs.

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,010
Amor de Loca Juventud and others.

74
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,310
You might also like this,
Diferente by Gotan Project.

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,730
Gotan Project, a Argentinian band,
really cool one,

76
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,700
more like Gypsy Kings, Flamenco
band this all makes a lot of sense.

77
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,226
Remember the song down here
by Gotan Project, Criminal,

78
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,418
which I kinda like as well.

79
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:53,849
