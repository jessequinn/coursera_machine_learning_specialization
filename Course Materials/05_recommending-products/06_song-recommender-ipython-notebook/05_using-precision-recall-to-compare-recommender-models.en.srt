2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,020
So, we've now seen this models in action.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:15,760
And we've done this, what we call a kind

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,790
of qualitative, just kind of
anecdotal qualitative exploration.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,380
Let's do a more quantitative comparison

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,700
between the personalize model and
the popularity model.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,079
So, now we're going to do

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,704
a quantitative comparison

9
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:43,120
between the models.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,310
So as we explored with
family in the lectures,

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,230
when we're comparing recommenders,
a good metric to use is precision recall.

12
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,402
So can we explore the precision
recall curve for these two models?

13
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:06,020
We discussed matplotlib
in a different notebook,

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,724
so we're gonna call matplotlib here, and

15
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:15,559
I'm gonna add this
little command inline to

16
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:20,265
make sure that matplotlib actually prints

17
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:25,380
into the recommender,
so into the notebook.

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:34,170
So matplotlib and what I'm gonna do
is compute the model_performance.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,240
This is the variable that I'm gonna
create, and there is this methoding in

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,265
the recommended libraries
from graphlab create.

21
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,615
It's a set of utilities for
recommenders and

22
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:53,855
one of those is really cool
is called compare_models.

23
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:57,725
Try it to compare different recommenders
models and understand how they do.

24
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:01,956
So I'm gonna compare different
recommenders models on our

25
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,668
test_data that we're separating.

26
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:10,329
And the models I'm gonna compare
are popularity_model and

27
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:17,554
the personalize_model, so here's a list
of the two models in comparison.

28
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,580
I could have compare more, but
I'm just going to compare those two.

29
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,190
And I want to say there is a little
parameter here called user sample,

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,030
where I'm going to sample a small
fraction of the test data.

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,456
So a user sample equals 0.05,
because on this

32
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:43,550
machine building this [INAUDIBLE]
takes a little while,

33
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,950
and they want it to be fast so
we can look at it together.

34
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,240
So, it does it pretty fast.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,380
It's comparing, it's evaluating first
the performance of the popularity model.

36
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,090
That's model zero.

37
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,380
Then the performance of the second model,

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,320
model one,
which was the personalized model.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,350
And finally what we get here
is a precisionary call curves.

40
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,040
The last thing that we
saw in the lectures and

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,910
this compares the recall and
precision of these two models.

42
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,000
The personalized model in green and
the popularity model in blue.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,680
And the closer you are to
the top here the better,

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,920
you see that adding personalization
significantly improves.

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,080
The performance of our recommender.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,870
So, personalization's great.

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,000
Just recommending popular items,
not so great.

48
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,070
And so, with this,
we've built a song recommender and

49
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,979
we explored that, we saw it recommend cool
songs for somebody like me who likes U2

50
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:52,070
and Buena Vista Social Club.

51
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,677
But of course you can go and explore
all the things that you might like and

52
00:03:57,677 --> 00:04:02,653
see what else other recommendation
songs you can come up with.

53
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:06,709
