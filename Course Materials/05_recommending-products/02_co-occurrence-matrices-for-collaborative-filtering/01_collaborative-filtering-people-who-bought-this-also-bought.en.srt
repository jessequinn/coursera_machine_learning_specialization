2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:08,426
So this notion of collaborative filtering
is that somehow we wanna leverage

3
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,880
what other people have purchased.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,530
And the case of product recommendation or
other links more generically between

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,390
users and items,
to make recommendations for other users.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,310
And so it seems very intuitive that
when we're thinking about doing product

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,700
recommendation that we wanna
build in information like

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,400
if a person bought this item, then

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,320
they're probably also interested in some
other item because we've seen lots and

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,770
lots of examples in the past of people
buying those pairs of items together.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,100
Maybe not simultaneously,
at the same time, but

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,590
in the course of their purchase histories.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,130
Okay, so this brings us to the idea
of co-occurrence of purchases.

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,420
So, for example, if I was just on Amazon,
buying diapers, well, we've probably

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,960
seen lots of examples of people who
bought diapers also bought baby wipes.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,756
Okay, so how can we use this
type of co-occurrence of

17
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:09,124
purchases to make recommendations?

18
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:13,982
[SOUND] Okay [LAUGH] so
let's talk about this co-occurrence

19
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:16,963
matrix that we're gonna build up.

20
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:21,625
And this is gonna store all of our
information about which purchases

21
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,615
people bought together.

22
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,685
And again, when I say together
I don't mean simultaneously,

23
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:32,290
just together at some point in
their history of purchases.

24
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,590
So I'm gonna build up this Matrix C and
this matrix is an items by items matrix.

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,350
Okay, so we're gonna list
all the different items for

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,940
our rows of this matrix.

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,120
And likewise, all the different items,
for the columns.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,940
So, for example,
maybe this row of this matrix,

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,540
might be the row corresponding to diapers.

30
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,268
And then if this is lets say
the third row of this matrix,

31
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:15,360
then I would also have that
the third column of this

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,247
matrix Corresponds to diapers as well.

33
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:29,944
Okay, and so if I want to say that many
people purchased diapers and baby wipes,

34
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:35,219
let's look at the row for diapers and
then we scroll over to the column for,

35
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,679
let's say this column here,
is for baby wipes.

36
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:51,000
And in this entry, of this matrix
there's some number entered.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,569
And that number represents
the number of people.

38
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,115
Purchasing both diapers and baby wipes.

39
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:10,390
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

40
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,600
Is the number of people who
purchased diapers and baby wipes

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,270
the same as the number of people who
purchased baby wipes and diapers?

42
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,708
Yes, so we would go to the baby wipes row.

43
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:29,886
And this diapers column and

44
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:35,490
notice that this is
the exactly same number, okay?

45
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,873
And so what this means is
this a symmetric matrix that,

46
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:48,913
if we look across the diagonal here,
Then we're gonna see a reflection.

47
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:53,302
If we took this matrix and folded it
across that little diagonal line I

48
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:57,252
just drew you would get exactly
the same numbers matching up.

49
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:02,673
Okay, and just to reiterate the way we're
gonna build up this co-occurrence matrix,

50
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:07,875
is we're gonna search through all the
user's history of purchases they've made,

51
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,710
and count.

52
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,520
And every time we see
a purchase of diapers we'll add

53
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,260
of diapers along with all the other items,
we're gonna add one to that entry,

54
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,970
and we're gonna keep incrementing that
matrix as we're searching over users.

55
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,970
Okay, but now let's talk about how we're
gonna use this co-occurrence matrix

56
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,030
in order to make recommendations.

57
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,110
And it's really, really straight forward.

58
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,560
So let's say that a user has
just purchased diapers, and

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
I wanna make some recommendation for them.

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,269
Well what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
look at the diapers row of this matrix,

61
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:49,126
so if we go back, to that, C matrix here,

62
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:54,474
I'm gonna grab out this diapers row,
and I'm just gonna draw that row here.

63
00:04:57,045 --> 00:05:01,944
And what this row has is how
often people bought diapers and,

64
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:05,510
remember, baby wipes was one of the items.

65
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,430
Oops, sorry, not baby items, baby wipes.

66
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,650
And that has, let's say a 100 counts.

67
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,720
And then there's also let's say pacifiers.

68
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,900
And maybe there are 4 counts of pacifiers.

69
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,470
Let's think of something else.

70
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:38,620
So let's say that there's some DVD,
let's say there's no counts of those DVDs.

71
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,500
We're gonna have this whole vector
of counts of how many times people

72
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,920
who bought diapers,
bought all these other products.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,020
Using this,

74
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,680
now we can very straightforwardly
make our recommendations.

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,510
All we do is we sort this vector and

76
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,640
recommend the items with
the largest counts.

77
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,399
So maybe, we'll recommend baby wipes,
and milk, and baby food, and

78
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,543
things like this for
somebody who just purchased diapers.

79
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:10,639
