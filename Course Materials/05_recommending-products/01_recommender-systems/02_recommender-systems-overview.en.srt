2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:07,440
Okay, so in this module we're gonna
talk about recommender systems.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,300
And one prototypical example of where
recommender systems are really useful

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,910
is in recommending products.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,350
So imagine you have a large set of
products and there are some users, and

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,800
you wanna recommend a subset of
your products to those users.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,920
Well the question is,
how are we gonna do this?

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,650
And what we're going to talk about is how
to use machine learning techniques in

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,590
order to use the past history of your
own purchases, as well as the purchases

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,030
of other people, to determine which
products to recommend to you.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,920
And recommender systems just have a
really, really wide range of applications

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,290
and they've exploded in
popularity over the last decade.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,990
But Amazon was an early pioneer in this
area, focused on an application we're

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,940
gonna be talking about,
which is product recommendation.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,810
But another example that really
popularized recommender systems was

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,770
a competition that Netflix ran
starting back in 2006, ending in 2009,

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,120
where there was a $1 million prize for
the person who provided

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,890
the best recommender system for
recommending movies to users.

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,240
And we'll talk a little bit about
that application in this module.

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,702
But it really spurred a lot
of activity in this area,

21
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:22,335
developing new recommender systems and
a lot of research following that.

22
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:26,379
