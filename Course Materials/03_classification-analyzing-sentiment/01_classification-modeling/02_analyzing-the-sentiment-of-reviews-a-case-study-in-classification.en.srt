00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:06,450
Today we're gonna talk
about classification.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,550
Which is perhaps one of the most
common areas of machine learning,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,900
one of the most used, and
useful areas of machine learning.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,350
And perhaps,
one of those most intuitive ones as well.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,790
So things like figuring out
whether your email's spam or

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,390
not, or whether a document
comes from a sports topic, or

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,920
it's about politics, or
it's about entertainment, and so on.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,188
But as usual,
we're going to start with a use case,

10
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:35,699
which is an exciting one,
around restaurant reviews.
