[MUSIC] In this module we talked about
building sentiment analysis tools using classification. And now in this notebook,
we are actually gonna go ahead and build one of those things. So we're gonna build a sentiment
analyzer for products. So let's go ahead and get started. Okay, so here we are on
an iPython notebook as usual. And again, I'm gonna hide the header. Before I hide the header, I want to change
it's name, so let's rename the notebook. So we're gonna call this
Analyzing product sentiment, since this is the notebook we're building,
and I'm gonna hide the header and
I'm going to hide the toolbar just to have
a little bit more space. And we're gonna be using
GraphLab Create today so I'm going to import GraphLab
to get ourselves started. Here we go. So the first thing that we're
gonna do is read some data. So let's read some product review data. Let me read some product review data. And this is real data set
that we're going to read. So I'm gonna create an SFrame
called products which uses graphlab.SFrame from a local
file I've downloaded the data. You are going to download the data too. And this is some Amazon
baby product data set. Okay. We've downloaded that data, and so the first thing that we're gonna do is
do a little bit of data exploration. So, let's explore this data together. And this is fun. So we have some product data, so
let's just look at the head of this table. So the head is just the first few lines
of this table that I've loaded up. And so as you can see, it's composed of
three things, the name of the product. So Planetwise Flannel Wipes for
your product. The review is Planetwipes are just okay
but in my opinion something, something. And the rating is three. And it's out of five stars so a three
is kind of middle of the road rating. While the Planentwise Wipe Pouch,
this reviewer really liked it, they gave it a rating of five. So this is the data set
that we're working with. [MUSIC]
