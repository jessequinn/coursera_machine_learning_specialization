1
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:12,310
So let's take a look at
what products we have.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,730
So, let's look at what reviews we have for
different product names.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,920
And here,
we're gonna use the canvas again,

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,290
to do a little bit of visualization.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,780
And so, as with before,
I'm going to do graphlab.canvas, and

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,520
we'll set the target to be
my ipath to on notebook so

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,930
it will show up right here on the ipath
on notebook as we're building this.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,670
Now we can take one of the columns
of this s frame of the product.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,600
So for example,
let's take the name of the product,

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,150
and we can just hit .show on it,
and that's gonna show

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,650
a histogram of the different names of
the different products in this data set.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,970
So, for example, right here.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,065
So we see that this particular product,
Vulli Sophie something gets the most

14
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:08,231
reviews, 785 reviews as compared
to like simple wishes something,

15
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:14,080
something, 562 reviews and you can see
that the number of reviews go down.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,270
Fisher Price products 489, 450.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,160
This is different baby products
here that we're analyzing and

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,120
you'll see the histogram of the different
reviews of different products,

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,200
number of reviews, so
let's visit that first Vulli Sophie.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,760
What is that?

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,858
So let me tell you a little
bit more about that product.

22
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:38,620
So let's explore the so

23
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:45,138
called Vulli Sophie and
this is an extremely popular product,

24
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:50,160
so it's actually,
I happen to have one right here.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,360
This is Vulli Sophie, the giraffe teether.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,180
So it's a little plastic giraffe.

27
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,580
It's the most gifted product for
babies on Amazon.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,850
And it's a teether, which means
like babies like to chew on it.

29
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,900
So lots of reviews for
this giraffe for babies to chew on,

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,935
and it's made out of plastic and squeaks.

31
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:12,295
[SOUND] So this is what we're
gonna talk about a lot today,

32
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:13,980
this little giraffe [SOUND].

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,090
Now, let's look at the reviews for
this particular giraffe.

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,920
So, I'm gonna call it giraffe.

35
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,630
Giraffe reviews.

36
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,398
And then we're going to take all
of those products that I have,

37
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:34,616
all those product reviews,
and I am going to select,

38
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:39,397
this is another filter,
I am going to select those rows where

39
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:45,050
the product name is equal to
the name of this particular giraffe.

40
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,081
So this is Vulli Sophie

41
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:56,691
the Giraffe Teether.

42
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:00,650
This is the product that
we've been talking about.

43
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:09,760
So if we take a quick look here,
if I ask for the length of this new thing,

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,833
giraffe reviews, this table, you see
there's 785 reviews for this plastic toy.

45
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,715
[NOISE] Little teether.

46
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:23,035
So, 785 reviews, and
let's look at the ratings.

47
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:28,365
So, I'm gonna take the giraffe_reviews,
the ratings, just for

48
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:32,710
this particular product, and I'm gonna
do a .show in it like we've been doing.

49
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,970
I wanna look at particular view
called the categorical view.

50
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,220
Which is going to give me,
categorical view.

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,703
It's gonna give me a, sort of
a histogram of the different reviews and

52
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,490
how many scores we got.

53
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,800
So, if you take a look at
this little histogram here,

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,340
you will see something
kind of interesting.

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,100
People love this thing.

56
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,550
535 the reviews were five stars.

57
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,950
This is a product 535 five star reviews.

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,370
Then the next most common is four stars,
then three stars.

59
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,850
Then it jumps down to one star,
and finally two stars.

60
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,370
So a good, sizable amount of
people really hated this product.

61
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,270
But most people loved it.

62
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,818
It would be fun to do a kind
of sentiment analysis try

63
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:20,370
to understand where the really
negative reviews or

64
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,590
the really positive reviews what
this review is talking about.

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,880
Just like we discussed in
the lectures in this module.

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,220
To do that,
we'll build a sentiment classifier.

67
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,039
