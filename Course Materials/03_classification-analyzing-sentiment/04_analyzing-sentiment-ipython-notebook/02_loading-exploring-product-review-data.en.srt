2
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:08,294
In this module we talked about
building sentiment analysis tools

3
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:10,340
using classification.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,520
And now in this notebook,
we are actually gonna go ahead and

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,910
build one of those things.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,350
So we're gonna build a sentiment
analyzer for products.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,020
So let's go ahead and get started.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,330
Okay, so here we are on
an iPython notebook as usual.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,050
And again, I'm gonna hide the header.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,520
Before I hide the header, I want to change
it's name, so let's rename the notebook.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,545
So we're gonna call this
Analyzing product sentiment,

12
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:45,689
since this is the notebook we're building,
and

13
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,707
I'm gonna hide the header and
I'm going to hide

14
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:55,870
the toolbar just to have
a little bit more space.

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,522
And we're gonna be using
GraphLab Create today so

16
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm going to import GraphLab
to get ourselves started.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,420
Here we go.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,166
So the first thing that we're
gonna do is read some data.

19
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:15,005
So let's read some product review data.

20
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:23,100
Let me read some product review data.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,600
And this is real data set
that we're going to read.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,880
So I'm gonna create an SFrame
called products which uses

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,830
graphlab.SFrame from a local
file I've downloaded the data.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,920
You are going to download the data too.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,290
And this is some Amazon
baby product data set.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,850
Okay.

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,870
We've downloaded that data, and so

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,230
the first thing that we're gonna do is
do a little bit of data exploration.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,836
So, let's explore

30
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:04,540
this data together.

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,880
And this is fun.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,790
So we have some product data, so
let's just look at the head of this table.

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,520
So the head is just the first few lines
of this table that I've loaded up.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,470
And so as you can see, it's composed of
three things, the name of the product.

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,220
So Planetwise Flannel Wipes for
your product.

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,760
The review is Planetwipes are just okay
but in my opinion something, something.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,880
And the rating is three.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,960
And it's out of five stars so a three
is kind of middle of the road rating.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,020
While the Planentwise Wipe Pouch,
this reviewer really liked it,

40
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,250
they gave it a rating of five.

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,220
So this is the data set
that we're working with.

42
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,729
