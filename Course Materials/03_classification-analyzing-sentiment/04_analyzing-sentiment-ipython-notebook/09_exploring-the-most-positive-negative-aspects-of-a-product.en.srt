[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:08,477
So for that first review,
they had product sentiment predicted as 1,

3
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:10,660
let's take a look at that review.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,580
So I'm gonna look at the giraffe_reviews.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,198
The first one is 0, the index 0, and let's
look at the actual text of the review.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,670
Okay, I'm gonna read
this to you a little bit.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,341
It says, Sophie, oh Sophie,
your time has come.

8
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:33,860
My granddaughter, Violet is 5
months old and starting to teeth.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,750
What a joy for little Sophie.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,070
Little Sophie brings to Violet.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,006
Oh Violet really loves Sophie [SOUND].

12
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:47,555
Sophie is made of very pliable
rubber that is sturdy but not tough.

13
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:54,945
And it's quite easy for Violet to twist
all her positions and put it in her mouth.

14
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:57,445
Okay, that's the right
positive review looks like.

15
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:01,655
She write a poem about Sophie.

16
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,855
Let's look at the second
placed review here.

17
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:13,340
So tihs is the, for element 1, so
it's the second element on the table.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,663
And let's look at what
that review looks like.

19
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:25,865
And here's what it says, I'm not sure why
Sophie is such a hit with the little ones,

20
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:31,230
but my 7 month old baby girl
is one of the adoring fans.

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,708
The rubber is softer and
pleasant to handle.

22
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:38,123
My daughter enjoy chewing on it,
[SOUND] on the legs, chewing on the legs,

23
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,205
nubs of the head.

24
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:42,362
So these ears get chewed and so on.

25
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:45,770
[SOUND] She really loves it and
she loves that squeaky, so

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,518
apparently it's a big hit.

27
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:50,350
So this is two positive reviews.

28
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,310
Now let me show you a little python
trick which you can use to show

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,990
the most negative reviews.

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,770
So the most negative reviews
are at the bottom of the table.

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,650
So we could ask what is
the length from the table and

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,530
find the last element and so on.

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,160
But with python,
we can do this really easily.

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,340
So let me show you what's happening next.

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:17,768
Show most negative reviews.

36
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:23,900
So we can take this table and just index
it with a negative number, minus 1.

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,280
And what that does is it goes
to the end of the table.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,460
So minus one is the last element,

39
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,540
minus two is the second to last element,
and so on.

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,320
So let's look at the most
negative review for our giraffe.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:42,840
And I forgot to put a quote here,
so let's just do that and execute.

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,340
Okay.

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,890
Here's a negative review
about poor Sophie.

44
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,314
My son loved Sophie.

45
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:56,040
I bought one for
every baby shower I've gone to.

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,630
Now, my daughter is 6 months old
just today nearly choked on it.

47
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,491
Now I'll never give it to her again.

48
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:06,430
So the problem is this person's
daughter is really scary,

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,750
almost choked by trying
to swallow this giraffe.

50
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,670
And so you see a negative review of
somebody talking about how this giraffe,

51
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,830
which is a lovely chewing toy,
is also a choking hazard.

52
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,080
Let's look at the second
most negative review.

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,970
So again, giraffe and minus 2,

54
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,450
second most negative review and
we'll take a quick look at it.

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,600
So one thing that people don't like about
it is it might be a choking hazard.

56
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,190
So let's see what this one says.

57
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,180
This children's toy is nostalgic and
very cute.

58
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,620
That sounds pretty positive.

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,250
Even the second most negative
review starts pretty positive.

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,630
However, the distinct rubber smell and
very old odd taste.

61
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,990
Yes, I tried it.

62
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,990
So this person tried to chew his or
her kid's toy.

63
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,698
That my baby did not enjoy.

64
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:05,610
So apparently, the rubber smells and

65
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,910
this person wasn't able to clean it.

66
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,670
And the kid did not like it.

67
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,510
And they overpaid for this toy.

68
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,030
So the second thing that people complain
about is that this is a smelly toy.

69
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,230
Smells okay to me, but could be an issue.

70
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,929
Okay, so now in a few lines of code,
we build a sentiment analysis.

71
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,930
A system that can actually look at
reviews and really sort them and

72
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,907
show really positive and negative
aspects of this particular product.

73
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:41,309
