2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:07,921
Okay, so up to this point we just
considered fitting the data with a line

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,560
and the question is,
what does a good choice?

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,360
So I'm actually feeling pretty good about
my analysis to be pretty truthful here.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,900
I fit this line, I minimize the residual
sum of squares, I made a prediction for

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,610
my house value.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,890
In doing so I leveraged all these
observations that I went through and

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,550
recorded of all the recent house sales.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,950
And I go and I go to Carlos and
I say, hey, look at my analysis.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,480
This is my estimate of
the value of our house.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,520
And he goes, well, I'm not so sure.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,944
Because really, to me,
I'm not sure that this is a linear trend.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,384
He actually says
>> It's not linear.

14
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:51,320
>> He says it's not linear.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,890
Or according to my cartoon, he says,
dude, that's not a linear relationship.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,730
Dude.

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,710
No, I guess Carlos would not say dude.

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,630
But, anyway.
>> He says bro.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,820
>> He says bro.

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
Bro.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,570
He always refers to me as bro, of course.

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,750
Okay.

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,250
But anyway, the point is Carlos doesn't
think that it's a linear relationship.

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,400
He thinks, you know maybe it's quadratic.

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,600
He said did you try a quadratic fit?

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,060
Well.

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,880
Now I look at the plot that
he just put up here and

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,320
I say actually that looks pretty good.

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,990
And what do I have to do?

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,240
I have to figure out which is
the best quadratic fit to this data.

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,790
And how am I gonna do that?

33
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,230
I'm gonna go again and I'm gonna
minimize my residual sum of squares.

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,150
So I'm just about to go minimize
my residual sum of squares.

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,900
So let's talk about what that
would involve because when I'm

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,910
looking at a quadratic function I
now have three parameters here.

37
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:57,478
I have my still my intercept,
which is just where is this curve?

38
00:01:57,478 --> 00:01:59,740
Up and down on the y axis.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,810
And then I have this linear term of x, and

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,490
then I also have this extra term here,
which is now the square of x.

41
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,240
That's where I get that
quadratic component.

42
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,080
But I wanna make one quick comment here,
so a little aside,

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,610
that this is actually still
called linear regression.

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,800
And the reason is because we think of
x squared just as another feature.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,130
And what we see is that the w's
always appear just as w's,

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,900
not w squared or other functions of w.

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,470
And we're going to discuss this in
more detail in the regression course.

48
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,120
But remember, even though we're talking
about a quadratic function fit to

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,630
the data,
this is still called linear regression.

50
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,450
Okay but the point I want to make
here is we have three parameters

51
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,610
when I'm going to minimize
my residual sum of squares,

52
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,820
I'm going to have to search over
the space of three different things now.

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,110
I have to minimize over the combination
of best w zero, w one and

54
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,179
w two and finding the quadratic fit that
minimizes my residual sum of squares.

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,010
Okay, so I'm just about to go and

56
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,530
do this computation, which actually turns
out to also be efficient and again we

57
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,380
are going to discuss the generality
of that in the regression course.

58
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,620
But then Carlos has a brilliant idea.

59
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,890
He says wait, wait wait!

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,910
I told you about that quadratic, but
did you try a 13th order polynomial?

61
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,580
And I go, no I didn't.

62
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,380
>> It makes sense.

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,080
>> It does, it makes a lot of sense.

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,490
Look at this, this is pretty good.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
This is the fit that Carlos gets
with his 13th order polynomial.

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,520
He says, I just minimized
your residual sum of squares.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,230
Pretty good, right?

68
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,350
My residual sum of squares
here are basically zero.

69
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,700
But I'm personally not feeling so
great about this.

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,640
Cuz I'm looking and
I'm saying my house isn't worth so little.

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,689
I know that, I do.

72
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:58,060
Yes, we talked about residual sum of
squares as being this cost of the fit.

73
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,440
And yes,
Carlos seems to have really really really

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,490
minimized my residual sum of squares, but
something's not sitting right with me.

75
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,037
This function just looks crazy.

76
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:11,679
