[MUSIC] In fact, we can actually look at the
coefficients with that line for our model. So we can take this square foot model that
we built and we can call the function get. And we can get the coefficients. So these are what in the chorus
we call the weights. And so, there are two weights,
two coefficients. The first one is the intercept to
where this line crosses the y axis. In this case, -$44,000. And the second one is the coefficient
of the square feet, so this angle, which corresponds to, if you interpret it
in this case, the price per square feet. How much does a square
foot of a house cost? 500 a square foot, how much it adds. And its $280 per square foot. This is the kind of average for Seattle. Some houses cost more per square foot,
the ones up here. Some houses cost less. But on the average, if you think about it,
it's about $208 per square foot, or at least according to
this regression model. [MUSIC]
