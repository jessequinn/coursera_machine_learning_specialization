00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:08,090
In fact, we can actually look at the
coefficients with that line for our model.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:14,270
So we can take this square foot model that
we built and we can call the function get.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,750
And we can get the coefficients.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,890
So these are what in the chorus
we call the weights.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,390
And so, there are two weights,
two coefficients.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,840
The first one is the intercept to
where this line crosses the y axis.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,436
In this case, -$44,000.

9
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:43,805
And the second one is the coefficient
of the square feet, so this angle,

10
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:50,410
which corresponds to, if you interpret it
in this case, the price per square feet.

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,636
How much does a square
foot of a house cost?

12
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,880
500 a square foot, how much it adds.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,760
And its $280 per square foot.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,990
This is the kind of average for Seattle.

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,280
Some houses cost more per square foot,
the ones up here.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,810
Some houses cost less.

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,949
But on the average, if you think about it,
it's about $208 per square foot, or

18
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:11,240
at least according to
this regression model.
