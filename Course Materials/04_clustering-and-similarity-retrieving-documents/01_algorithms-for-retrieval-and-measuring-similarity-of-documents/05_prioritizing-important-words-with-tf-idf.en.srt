2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:07,632
So the normalized count vectors that
we just described helped address some

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,959
of the issues with our original
proposal of just using raw

4
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:14,033
word counts as our
representation of the document.

5
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:18,587
But there's another issue, which is
often what we'd like to do is really

6
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:21,463
emphasize the important
words in a document.

7
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:25,526
So we're gonna discuss a little bit about
what it means to be an important word and

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,640
how we can think about emphasizing them.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,210
Okay, before we talk about important
words, let's first talk about rare words.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,730
So again, let's imagine that we're
reading an article about soccer, and

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,340
in this article there are lots and
lots of common words like the and

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,100
player and field and goal.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,540
And what we mean by a common word,

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,940
it's a word that appears
frequently in the corpus.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,240
In the corpus, that's just terminology for
all the documents out there

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,210
that we are looking at when we're
doing this task of retrieval.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,770
And what happens though is that these
common words dominate the similarity

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,130
metric that we talked about when we
compare against other documents because,

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,650
like I said, these words appear
in lots and lots of documents.

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,570
Whereas in contrast,

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,560
there are some very rare words in
this document we're looking at.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,270
Words like "futbol" and "Messi",
the specific player we're reading about,

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,630
that get completely swamped
by all these common words.

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,210
And these words,
like "futbol" and "Messi",

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,650
they get swamped because they just
appear very infrequently in the corpus.

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,800
So let's think about how to increase
the importance of these rare words,

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,040
because those often are the ones that
are really relevant in describing what's

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,260
unique about this article, and what might
indicate which other articles out there,

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,580
Carlos for example,
is interested in reading.

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,838
Okay, so like we said,
what characterizes a rare word is the fact

31
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:01,375
that it infrequently
appears in the corpus and

32
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:06,456
what we wanna do is we somehow wanna
up-weight these rare words and

33
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:13,169
equivalently to thinking about emphasizing
words that only appear in a few documents,

34
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:18,430
we can think about taking each word and
discounting the weight on that

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,178
word based on how many documents that
word appears in in the entire corpus.

36
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,818
Okay, so a question is, do we really
want to just emphasize the rare words?

37
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:32,690
Well, we clearly don't want to
emphasize the very common words,

38
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,410
the words like the and a and
it and everything like that.

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,870
But what we wanna include are things that
are very relevant for that document.

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,480
So not just words like Messi, but
also probably soccer and field and goal.

41
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,380
Things that describe the sport
that we're looking at,

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,500
which might be different than even
another article about sports.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,410
An article about basketball
that talks about basketball

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,700
hoop and court and words like that.

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,330
So in this case, we wanna emphasize
what I'll call important words.

46
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:08,830
Okay?

47
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,409
And so what we're gonna trade off
here is we're gonna think about

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,090
Words that appear very
frequently in the document so

49
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,500
they're relevant to the document
that we're currently reading.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,270
So I'll call this common locally.

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,572
And at the same time we want them to
appear relatively infrequently in

52
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:32,692
the corpus so I'll call this rare globally
and what characterizes a quote unquote

53
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:37,980
important word Is some trade off between
this local frequency, and global rarity.

54
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,909
