00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:07,600
Okay, so in this module, we're gonna
talk about clustering and similarity.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,790
And the point here is the fact that
often we have lots of observations, and

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,350
we want to infer some kind of structure
underlying these observations.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,190
And in this case,
the structure we're gonna talk about is

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,980
groups of related observations or
clusters.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,860
And as with all of our modules,

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,450
we're gonna motivate everything with
a real world application, a case study.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,210
In this case we're gonna talk about a task
of retrieving documents of interest.
