2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,250
So, this is going to be pretty simple.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,320
It'll be similar to the document
retrieval notebook that we did to find

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,130
documents that were similar to Barack
Obama, to Clinton, to Beckham, and others.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,772
So, let's go ahead and

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:28,808
what we're going to do is train

7
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:35,077
a nearest-neighbors model for

8
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:43,215
retrieving images using deep features.

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,840
So this is going to be pretty simple.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,890
And we're gonna call it the, knn_model,
just like we did with document retrieval.

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,471
And when I use graphlabs

12
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:04,240
nearest neighbors toolkit,

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,845
and we're going to code the create
verb to actually create this

14
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:12,636
nearest-neighbors model, and
just like in the nearest-neighbors model,

15
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:18,100
we're going to give it some data, so
in this case it would be my train data.

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm going to tell it what features to use.

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:30,614
So the features that I'm going to use are
going to be exactly those deep features.

18
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:40,010
And then just as a reminder,
you can give it a label ID.

19
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,059
So the label here, we're going to use
the image ID, which will then allow

20
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:50,199
us to go back and find the images that
correspond to the nearest neighbors.

00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:56,219
